  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>“OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“No; I am not tired of life. Who could be on such a
day? I am weary simply of this way of living. I want
to get away—away from this stagnant hole. It is the
same dull story over and over again, day after day, world
without end, amen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you be a bit more contented in any other
spot?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so. I cannot believe that mankind in general
is so selfish, so hypocritical, and, worst crime of all, so
hopelessly stupid as it is here. The world is 25,000
miles in circumference. Why spend all one’s days in
this split in the mountains?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, tell me, what is your ambition, then? Have
you one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would smile pityingly if I told it you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I’ll be as serious as—as you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then incline thine ear. I would I were the ruler of
a savage tribe, in the heart of far-away New Zealand,
shut in by towering mountains from the outer world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why spend all one’s days in a valley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, if you’re going in for a valley, why not
have a good one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She throws herself down beside him on the grass and
clasps her arms about his neck. “You foolish boy; you
don’t know what you want.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t I?” He draws the glowing face to his and
kisses it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two are idling in a grassy nook on the slope of
one of Vermont’s green hills, sheltered by a clump of
spruce from observation and the slanting rays of the sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is an infinite calm in the late spring air, and
the golden afternoon drifts by on lazy pinions. Away
in the west, across the vale, the main spur of the Green
Mountain range awaits the last pencilings of the low-descending
sun. Southward Wild River sings its way
through buttercup and daisy flecked meadows; to the
north the smoke from the chimneys of Raymond blurs
the lines of as fair a landscape as earth can boast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Derrick Ames pulls his hat over his eyes, stretches
himself on the greensward and gazes long and lovingly
at his companion. The fair face, browned by many rambles
among the hills; the rippling hair, tumbled in confusion
about mischievous and laughter-laden brown
eyes; the rounded arms; the slim, girlish figure, about
which even the coarse dress donned for mountain climbing
falls in graceful lines; the dainty feet and the perfectly
turned ankles, make a picture for an artist.</p>

<p class='c011'>She picked up the book which lies open upon the
grass and glances over its pages, dreamily.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun goes down in a golden haze, and still the
lovers tarry in their sylvan trysting-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is getting late and damp; we had better be moving,”
he says, finally.</p>

<p class='c011'>They arise and take their way across the pasture, their
arms clasped about each other’s waist. Derrick is talking
in low, earnest tones, with an infrequent interruption
by his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s no use,” he exclaims, impatiently, in reply to a
protest on her part. “Twice I have spoken to your
father, with the same result. I have been refused and
insulted. He is selfish, overbearing—”</p>

<p class='c011'>She places one hand upon his lips. “But will you not
make a third trial—for my sake,” she pleads.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For your sake I would do anything,” he answers,
pressing the soft hand to his lips. “There is no time
like the present. Will you wait for me here?” She
nods. “Where will I find your father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the bank. I think he said he would be there all
the evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will return shortly, for I know what the answer
will be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She watches the erect form of her lover as he strides
down the road leading into the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadows deepen in the valley. The opalescent
light that hangs over the range fades into the darkening
gray. The moon rises in full, round splendor and transforms
the river into a silver torrent.</p>

<p class='c011'>The clanging of the Raymond town clock, as it hammers
out the hour of 8, rouses the girl. “Derrick should
be here soon,” she murmurs. Then she clutches her
heart with an exclamation of pain and terror.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a swift, sharp spasm, that passes away as quickly
as it came, and which leaves the girl for several minutes
afterward somewhat dazed. Footsteps echo in the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The result?” eagerly, anxiously queries the girl as
Derrick reaches her side.</p>

<p class='c011'>He must have walked swiftly. He is breathing hard
and his face is pale as the moonlight. Or is it the reflection
of that light?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come away from here, for God’s sake!” he exclaims
in a harsh, unnatural voice, half-dragging her into the
road. “I beg your pardon; I did not mean to be rough,”
he adds, as the astonished eyes of the girl look into his.
“Will you come for a walk, dear?” And as she follows,
mechanically, wonderingly, he walks swiftly away from
the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am all out of breath,” she protests, after a few moments
of the fierce pace he has set. And they stop to
rest at a spring beside the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have quarreled with father,” asserts the girl, half
questioningly; but Derrick remains silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stops suddenly, and, holding her in his arms,
smooths back the dark ringlets from her moist brow.
“Helen, darling, do not press me for an answer to-night.
Let us be happy in the present. God knows it may not
be for long.” He presses a passionate kiss upon the
girl’s unresisting and unresponsive lips, and then lifts
to the moonlight a face as troubled as the tossing river
behind the dusky willows. As he releases her he extends
his arm toward the ball of silver that is wheeling
up the heavens. “See!” he cries. “The moon is up
and it is a glorious night. Shall we follow that pathway
of silver over the hills and far away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A loving look is her willing assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>The witchery that the moon is said to exert o’er mortals
must be more than a poet’s myth. A strange peace
has come upon the girl. Her senses are exalted. She
seems to be walking on air. Nor does she now
break upon the silence of her companion, whose agitation
has been replaced by a singular calm.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a stillness, yet what a busy world claims the
woods they are crossing to-night! The crawling of a
beetle through the dead leaves is distinctly heard, and a
thousand small noises that the day never hears fill the
forest with a strange music.</p>

<p class='c011'>A short distance farther and the wanderers emerge
into the open and pause to marvel at the picture spread
before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a wondrous night. Bathed in a radiance that
tips with silver every dew-laden spear of grass, the pasture
slopes down to a highway, and the brawling of the
brook beside it comes to their ears as a strain of music.</p>

<p class='c011'>Silently the lovers take their way through this fairyland,
clamber over the wall into the road, and continue
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am cold,” complains the girl, with a little shiver.
Derrick wraps his light overcoat about her shoulders.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>The striking of a town clock causes them both to
start.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are we?” asks the girl, looking about her in
bewilderment. The moon passes behind a cloud. The
spell is over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, this is Ashfield, isn’t it? There is the station,
and the church and the—Derrick! Derrick, where have
we been wandering? Five miles from home and midnight!
What will Louise and father say? We must
go home at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Home,” he repeats, bitterly, pointing to the north.
“There is no home yonder for me. Listen, Helen!”
He draws her to him fiercely. “If we part now it must
be forever. I shall never go back. I cannot go back!
Will you not come away with me—somewhere—anywhere?
Hark!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The whistle of the Montreal express sounds from the
north.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl seems not to hear him. The long whistle of
the express again echoes through the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Helen, darling!” There is a world of yearning and
entreaty in his voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>She throws her arms about him and kisses him. “Yes,
Derrick; I will go with you—to the end of the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The station agent regards the pair suspiciously. In
the dim light of the kerosene lamps of the waiting-room
their features are only partially discernible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorry,” he says, “but this train don’t stop except for
through passengers to New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But we are going to New York,” almost shouts Derrick.
“Quick, man!” The train has swept around the
curve above the village and is thundering down the
stretch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, I guess I kin accommerdate ye,” drawls the
station master. He seizes his lantern and swings it about
his head and No. 51 draws up panting in the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Elopement, I guess,” confides the station agent to
the conductor, as Derrick and the girl clamber aboard
the train.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter growls something about being twenty minutes
late out of St. Albans, swings his lantern and No.
51 rumbles away in the mist and moonlight.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE PRISONER OF WINDSOR—THE TRAGEDY OF A NIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Stanley, I have good news for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All news is alike to me, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Warden Chase of the Vermont state prison regards
the young man before him with a kindly eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your sentence of three years has been shortened by
a year, as the governor has granted you an unconditional
pardon,” he announces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His excellency is kind,” replied the young man in a
voice that expresses no gratitude and may contain a
faint shade of irony.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is a striking-looking young fellow, even in his
prison garb, his dark hair cropped close and his eyes
cast down in the passive manner enjoined by the prison
regulations. His height is about five feet ten inches
and his figure is rather slender and graceful. His face
is singularly handsome. His eyes are dark brown, almost
black, and the two long years of prison life have
dimmed but little of the fire that flashes from their depths.
A square jaw bespeaks a strong will. The rather hard
lines about the firm mouth were not there two years
before. He has suffered mentally since then. There
are too many gray hairs for a man of 28.</p>

<p class='c011'>Warden Chase touches a bell. “Get Stanley’s things,”
he orders the attendant, who responds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down, Stanley.” The young man obeys and the
warden wheels about to his desk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am authorized to purchase you a railroad ticket
to any station you may designate—within reason, of
course,” amends Mr. Chase. “Which shall it be?” A
bitter smile flits across Stanley’s face and he remains
silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“North, east, south or west?” questions Mr. Chase,
poising his pen in air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no home to go to,” finally responds Stanley,
lifting his eyes for the first time since his entrance to
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No home?” repeats the warden, sympathetically.
“But surely you must want to go somewhere. You
can’t stay in Windsor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanley is thoughtful. “Perhaps you had better make
the station Raymond,” he decides, and he meets squarely
the surprised and questioning look of the warden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that is the place you were sent from.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not your home? No; I believe you just stated
that you had no home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have none.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you wish to revisit the scene of your—your
trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanley’s gaze wanders to the open window and across
the valley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it’s your own affair,” says the warden, turning
to his desk. “The fare to Raymond is $2.50. I am also
authorized to give you $5 cash, to which I have added
$10. You have assisted me about the books of the
institution and have been in every respect a model prisoner.
In fact,” supplements Mr. Chase, with a smile,
“under different circumstances I should be sorry to part
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” acknowledges Stanley, in the same impassive
tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, my boy,” counsels the warden, laying one
hand kindly on the young man’s shoulder, “try to make
your future life such that you will never be compelled to
see the inside of another house of this kind. I am
something of a judge of character. I am confident that
you have the making of a man in you. Here are your
things,” as the attendant arrives with Stanley’s effects.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Chase resumes his writing and Stanley withdraws.
Once within the familiar cell, which is soon to know him
no more, his whole mood changes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Free!” he breathes, exultingly, raising his clasped
hands to heaven. “What matter it if my freedom be of
a few days only, of a few hours? It will be enough for
my purpose. Heavens! Two years in this hole, caged
like a wild beast, the companion of worse than beasts—a
life wrecked at 28. But I’ll be revenged! As surely
as there is a heaven above me, I’ll be repaid for my
months of misery. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He throws his prison suit from him with loathing.
Then he sinks back into his apathy and the simple toilet
is completed in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A suit of light gray, of stylish cut, a pair of well-made
boots, a negligee shirt and a straw hat, make considerable
change in his appearance. He smiles faintly as he dons
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>He ties his personal effects in a small package. They
are few—half a dozen letters, all with long-ago post-marks,
a couple of photographs, and a small volume of
Shakespeare given him by the warden, who is an admirer
of Avon’s bard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Off?” asks Mr. Chase, as he shakes hands. “Well,
you look about the same as when I received you. A
little older, perhaps”—surveying him critically—“and
minus what I remember to have been a handsome mustache.
Good-by, my boy, and good luck. And, I say,”
as Stanley strides toward the door, “take my advice and
the afternoon train for New York. Get some honest
employment and make a name for yourself. You’ve got
the right stuff in you. By the way, do you know what
day it is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not followed the calendar with reference to
any particular days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The 30th day of May—Memorial day,” says Mr.
Chase.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be a memorial day for me,” responds Stanley.
“Good-by, Mr. Chase, and thank you for your many
kindnesses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m rather sorry to have him go,” soliloquizes the
warden, as his late charge walks slowly away from the
institution. “Bright fellow, but peculiar—very peculiar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Stanley proceeds leisurely along the road leading to
the station. His eyes are bent down, and he seemingly
takes no note of the glories of the May day, of the
throbbings of the busy life about him. A procession
of Grand Army men, headed by a brass band that makes
music more mournful than the occasion seems to call
for, passes by on the dusty highway.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Homage for the dead; contumely for the living,” he
murmurs, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train for the north leaves at 4:30. Stanley spends
the time between in making some small purchases at
the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what hour do we arrive at Raymond?” he asks
the conductor, as the train pulls out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seven forty-five, if we are on time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” returns the young man. He draws his
hat over his eyes, and turns his face to the window.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>At 7:45 o’clock in the evening Sarah, the pretty housemaid
at the residence of Cyrus Felton, answers a sharp
ring at the door bell. In the semi-darkness of the vine-shaded
porch she distinguishes only the outlines of a
man who stands well back from the door. The gas has
not yet been lighted in the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Mr. Felton at home?” inquires the visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The young or the old Mr. Felton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The young or the old?” repeats the man to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sarah twists the door-knob impatiently. “Well?” she
says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon; I was not aware that there were
two Mr. Feltons. I believe the elder is the person I wish
to see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is not at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is in town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes. He went down-street about 7 o’clock, but
we expect him back before long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would he be likely to be at his office?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sarah does not know. Mr. Felton rarely goes to the
office evenings. Still, he may be there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the office is where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the bank block.” Sarah peers out at her questioner,
but, with a “thank you,” he has already stepped
from the porch. As he strides away in the dusk and the
house door slams behind him, a second figure leaves
the shadow of the trellis, moves across the lawn and
pauses at the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the bank building,” he muses. “One visitor ahead
of me. Well, there is no need of my hurrying,” and he
saunters toward the village, the electric lamps of which
have begun to flash.</p>

<p class='c011'>At 8:05, as Sarah afterwards remembers, Cyrus Felton
arrives home. Sarah comes into the hall to receive
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A gentleman called to see you, sir, about ten minutes
ago. Did you meet him on your way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably not. I have been over to Mr. Goodenough’s.
Did he leave any name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir. Oh, and here is a letter that a boy brought
a little while ago.” Sarah produces a note from the hall
table and disappears upstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton opens the note, glances at its contents
and utters an exclamation of impatience. He crumples
the paper in his hand, seizes his hat and hurries from
the house and down the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the brightly lighted room of Prof. George Black,
directly over the quarters of the Raymond National Bank,
a party of young men are whiling away a few pleasant
hours. The professor is lounging in an easy-chair, his
feet in another, and is lost in a “meditation” for violin, to
which Ed Knapp is furnishing a piano accompaniment.
Suddenly the professor rests his violin across his knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark!” he exclaims and bends his head toward the
open window. “Wasn’t that a shot downstairs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably,” assents one of the group. “The boys in
the bank have been plugging water rats in the river all
the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it’s too dark to shoot rats.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, one can aim pretty straight by electric light. Go
ahead with your fiddling, George. Get away from that
piano, Knapp, and let the professor give us the cavatina.
That’s my favorite, and your accompaniment would ruin
it. Let ’er go, professor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the strains of the Raff cavatina die away, a man
comes out of the entrance of the Raymond National
Bank. He glances swiftly up, then down the street. Then
he crosses the road in the shadow of a tall building and
hurries toward the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no train, north or south, before 11:50,” says
the telegraph operator, in response to a query at the window.
He is clicking off a message and does not turn
his head. His questioner vanishes.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>“Jim, Mr. Felton wants to see you,” the clerk of the
Raymond Hotel informs the sheriff of Mansfield County,
who is playing cards in a room off the office. Sheriff
Wilson is a man with a game leg, a war record, and a
wild mania for the diversion of sancho pedro. When he
sits in for an evening of that fascinating pastime he dislikes
to be disturbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s he want?” he asks absent-mindedly, for he
has only two more points to make to win the game.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dunno. He seems to be worked up about something.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“High, low, pede!” announces the sheriff triumphantly.
“Gentlemen, make mine a cigar.” He throws his
cards down and goes out into the office. Cyrus Felton
is pacing up and down excitedly. He grasps the officer
by the arm and half drags him from the hotel. When
they are out of hearing of the loungers he exclaims,
in a voice that trembles with every syllable:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Wilson, a fearful crime has been committed. Mr.
Hathaway has been murdered!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Murdered!” The sheriff’s excitement transcends that
of his companion, who is making a desperate effort to
regain his composure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is at the bank. I discovered him only a few
moments ago. Come, see for yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They soon reach the bank, which is only a stone’s
throw from the hotel. After passing the threshold of
the cashier’s office in the rear of the banking-room the
two men stop and look silently upon the grewsome
sight before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lying upon the floor, one arm extended toward and
almost touching the wide-open doors of the vault, is
the body of Cashier Roger Hathaway. His life has
ebbed in the crimson pool that stains the polished
floor.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>JACK ASHLEY, JOURNALIST.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>A loud pounding on the door of his room in the
tavern at South Ashfield awakens Mr. Jack Ashley from
a dream of piscatorial conquest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Four o’clock!” announces the disturber of his slumbers,
with a parting thump. Ashley rolls out of bed and
plunges his face into a brimming bowl of spring water.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is early dawn. A cool breeze, laden with the scent
of apple blossoms, drifts through the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God made the country and man made the town,”
quotes the young man, as he descends to the hotel office.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ain’t used to gittin’ up at this hour, be ye?” grins the
proprietary genius of the tavern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The habit, worthy host, has not fastened upon me
seriously. This is usually my hour for going to bed.
Hast aught to eat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Breakfas’ all ready,” with a nod toward what is
known as the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley shudders as he gazes at the spread. It is the
usual Vermont breakfast—weak coffee, two kinds of
pie on one plate, and a tier of doughnuts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gad! This country is a howling wilderness of pie!”
he mutters, surveying the repast in comical despair. “And
to flash it on a man at 4 a.m.! It is simply barbarous!”</p>

<p class='c011'>During his short vacation sojourn Mr. Ashley’s epicurean
tastes have suffered a number of distinct shocks.
But the ozone of the Green Mountains has contributed
toward the generation of an appetite that needs little
tempting to expend its energies. He makes a hearty
breakfast on this particular morning, drowns the memories
of the menu in a bowl of milk, and announces
to Landlord Howe that he is ready to be directed to the
best trout brook in central Vermont.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Howe surveys the eight-ounce bamboo with mild
disdain. “Them fancy rigs ain’t much good on our
brooks,” he declares. “Ketch more with a 75-cent rod.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am rather inclined to agree with you on that point,
most genial boniface; but it’s the only rod I happen
to have with me, and I expect to return with some
fish unless the myriad denizens of the brook which you
enthusiastically described last night exist only in your
imagination. By the way, what do you think of the
bait?” passing over a flask.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Howe’s faded blue eyes moisten and a kindly smile
plays over a countenance browned by many summers in
the hay field.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t buy that in Vermont,” he ventures.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly. I’m not lined with asbestos.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlord grins. It is a habit he has.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I keeps a little suthin’ on hand myself,” he confides
in a cautious undertone, although only the cattle are
listening. “But fact is, there ain’t no use er keepin’
better’n dollar’n a half a gallon liquor. The boys want
suthin’ that’ll scratch when it goes down. Now that, I
opine,” with an affectionate glance at the flask which
Ashley files away for future reference, “must a cost nigh
onter $3 a gallon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As much as that,” smiles Ashley. “That, most appreciative
of bonifaces, is the best whisky to be found
on Fulton street, New York. Well, I must be ‘driving
along.’ Where’s this wonderful brook of yours?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Follow that road round through the barnyard and
‘cross the basin to the woods. Good fishin’ for four
miles. And mind,” as Ashley saunters away, “don’t bring
back any trouts that ain’t six inches long, or the fish
warden will light on ye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks. If I should run across the warden—” and
Ashley holds up the flask.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’d fetch him, I reckon,” chuckles Mr. Howe.
Ashley vaults over the bars and strides across the
meadows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is in high feather. “This air rather discounts
an absinthe frappe for stimulative purposes,” he soliloquizes.
“Ah, here’s the wood, there’s the brook, and
if I mistake not, yonder pool hides a whopper just aching
for a go at the early worm.” But it doesn’t and Ashley
enters the forest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The farther he plunges into the spice-laden wilderness
the more is he enchanted with his surroundings.
Picture a cleft in the mountain whose sides drop almost
sheer to a gorge barely wide enough to accommodate a
wood road and a brook that parallels and often encroaches
upon it. Tall pines interlace and shut out the
direct rays of the sun and every now and then a cascade
comes tumbling somewhere aloft and plunges into a
broad, pebble-lined basin.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley sits by one of these pools, his wading boots
plunged deep in the crystal liquid, and pulls lazily on a
briar pipe, the reader is offered the opportunity of becoming
better acquainted with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is a prepossessing young fellow of something like
27, medium height and rather well built. Blue eyes and
an aggressive nose, on which gold-bowed eyeglasses are
airily perched, are characteristics of a face which has
always been a passport for its owner into all society
worth cultivating. A well-shaped head is adorned with
a profusion of blond curls, supplemented by a mustache
of silken texture and golden hue, which its possessor
is fond of twisting when he is in a blithesome humor,
which is often, and of tugging at savagely when in a reflective
mood, which is infrequent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is noted among his friends for chronic good
humor and unbounded confidence in his own abilities.
He is one of the brightest all-round writers on the New
York Hemisphere, and he knows it. The best of it is,
City Editor Ricker also knows it. All the office sings
of his exploits and “beats” and does their author reverence.
Jack always calls himself a newspaper man. That
is the sensible title. Yet he might wear the name of
journalist much more worthily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is in Vermont for his health. Five years of
continuous hustling on a big New York daily has necessitated
a breathing spell. He was telling Mr. Ricker that
his “wheels were all run down and needed repairing,”
and that he believed he would take his vacation early
this year.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you where you want to go,” volunteered the
city editor, who was “raised” among the Green Mountains
and served his apprenticeship gathering locals on
a Burlington weekly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right; let’s have it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take three weeks off and go up into Vermont.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Vermont—Vermont—where’s Vermont? O, yes, that
green daub on the map of New England. Railroad run
through there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, see here, Jack,” retorted Ricker, “you’re not
so confoundedly ignorant as you imply. That’s the
trouble with you New Yorkers who were born and bred
here. You consider everything above the Harlem River
a jay community. You’re a sight more provincial than
half the inhabitants of rural New England.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack laughed. “Come to think of it, you hailed from
there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and it’s a mighty good State to hail from. Now,
you run up to Raymond—it’s a little town about in the
Y of the Green Mountain range. You’ll not have Broadway,
with its theaters, and restaurants, and bars, but
you’ll get a big room, with a clean, airy bed to sleep
in—none of your narrow hall-chamber cots—and good,
plain, wholesome food to eat. Those necessities of life
which Vermont does not supply, good tobacco and good
whisky, you can take with you. You’ll come back feeling
like a fighting cock.” And before his chief finished painting
the attractions of the Green Mountain State, with
incidental references to John Stark and Ethan Allen,
Ashley was willing to compromise and two days later
found him en route for Raymond.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack fishes the brook as he does everything else—without
any waste of mental or physical exertion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landlord Howe did not deceive him. It is an excellent
trout brook, and by the time the sun is well up
he has acquired a well-filled creel. He is sauntering
along to what he has decided shall be the last pool, when,
as he turns a bend in the road, he runs upon a man
lying beside the path, with one arm shading his face and
clutching in the other hand a package.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” sings out Ashley, stopping short in surprise.
The man arises and passes his hand over his eyes in
bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Off the main road, aren’t you?” queries Ashley. The
stranger makes no reply. He bestows upon Ashley a
single searching glance and hurries down the road in the
direction of the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’ll be likely to know me again,” is Jack’s comment.
“Gad! What eyes! They went through me like
a stiletto. What the deuce is he prowling around here
for at this time o’ day? He isn’t a fisherman and he
can’t be farming it with those store clothes on. Well,
here goes for the last trout.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The last trout is not forthcoming, however, so the
fisherman unjoints his rod, reloads and fires his pipe and
strolls slowly back to the hotel. Landlord Howe sees
him as he comes swinging across the basin and waits
with some impatience until the young man gets within
hailing distance, when he informs him dramatically:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Big murder at Raymond last night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How big?” asks Ashley, with lazy interest. Murders
are frequent episodes in his line of business.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, it is the largest affair that Mr. Howe has known
of “round these parts since dad was a kid.” Roger
Hathaway, cashier of the Raymond National bank, has
been found murdered and the bank robbed of a large
sum of money, and there is no clew to the murderer.
The details of the tragedy have come over the telephone
wires early this morning, and the whole county is in a
fever of excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No clew?” muses Ashley, and his interest in the affair
grows. Then he thinks of the man he encountered on
the brook an hour ago. “Seen any strangers around
here?” he inquires of Mr. Howe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one ’cept you,” replies that worthy, contributing
a broad grin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I can prove an alibi,” laughs Jack. “I came
down from Raymond on the early evening train, and
everyone was alive in the town then, I guess. Are the
police of this village on the lookout?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, rather. The local deputy sheriff is on the alert
as never before in his life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not impossible that my early morning friend on
the brook was mixed up in last night’s affair,” thinks
Ashley. But he says nothing of the meeting. What is
the use? If the unknown was fleeing he must be pretty
well into the next county by this time. But in what direction?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Raymond murder is the one topic of the day at
South Ashfield. The villagers are gathered in force
about the hotel veranda and Ashley fancies that they
regard him a trifle askance as he hunts up a chair and
kills an hour while waiting for the up-train, in listening
to the rural persiflage of the group and the ingenious
theories of the local oracle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what time did the killing occur?” he inquires of
one of the loungers. Somewhere around 8 o’clock the
night before, he is informed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And no clew to the murderer,” he meditates. “Now,
if this was New York I’d take hold of the affair and work
it for all it was worth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He little dreams what effect the “affair” is to have on
his future. Yet as the train bears him to Raymond the
instinct of the newspaper man tells him that it is a cast
possessing phases of peculiar interest. And he is not
wholly unprepared for the telegram that is thrust into his
hands when he leaves the train.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of the disadvantages of telling your paper where
you intend spending your vacation,” he remarks as he
glances at the dispatch. Then to the telegraph operator:
“I’ll have a story for you after supper.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE STORY OF A CRIME.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The following dispatch appeared in the columns of the
New York Hemisphere, under the usual sensational headlines:</p>
<p class='c013'>“Raymond, Vt., May 31.—This quiet town among the
Green Mountains had cause indeed to mourn upon this
year’s occurrence of the nation’s Memorial Day. Last
evening, at the close of the most general observance of
the solemn holiday yet undertaken in Raymond, the community
was horror-stricken by the discovery of the foulest
crime ever committed within the limits of the state.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roger Hathaway, cashier of the Raymond National
Bank and treasurer of the Wild River Savings Bank,
was found murdered at the entrance of the joint vault
of the two institutions, which had been rifled of money
and securities aggregating, it is thought, not less than
$75,000. The crime had apparently been most carefully
planned and evidenced not only thorough familiarity
with the town and the interior arrangements of the
banks, but also the possession of the fact that the national
bank had on hand at the time an unusual amount of
ready money. The position of the murdered cashier and
the conditions of the rooms indicated also that the
official had met his death while endeavoring to protect
the funds entrusted to his care, his lifeless body, in fact,
barring the entrance to the rifled vault, a mute witness
to his faithfulness even unto death.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The Raymond National and Wild River Savings
Banks occupy commodious quarters on the ground floor
of Bank Block, a three-story brick structure on Main
Street, the principal business thoroughfare of the town.
The banking rooms are in the northern portion of the
block, occupying the entire depth of the building, the
only entrance being from Main Street. The north wall
of the block is parallel with a tributary of the Wild River,
which joins that stream, about 300 yards distant. The
interiors of the banking-rooms are plainly but conveniently
arranged. A steel wire cage extends east and west,
separating the officials of the institutions from the public,
with the customary counter and two windows for the
savings and national bank, respectively. At the rear
of the room is the private office of the cashier, separated
from the main room in part by the vault, an old-fashioned
brick affair, built into the partition in such a manner as
to be partly in both rooms. The iron doors to the vault
open into the cashier’s private office, although originally
designed to be entirely within the main office. Some
years prior the office of the cashier was enlarged to accommodate
the meetings of the directors, and the partition
was moved east, bringing the major portion of the
vault within the enlarged room. Two doors communicate
with the cashier’s room, one opening from the public
office, the other from the interior of the main banking-room.
Two large windows, looking respectively west
and north, afford light for the cashier’s office. Both
these windows are heavily barred, as indeed are the two
windows on the north side of the main office. A dark
closet, four by six feet, in the southwest corner of the
cashier’s room, serves in part as a storage-room for old
ledgers, account-books and supplies, and as a wardrobe
for employes.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was in the cashier’s room that the tragedy that has
so sadly marred the evening of Memorial Day took place,
that witnessed the awful struggle between the assassin
and the white-haired custodian of the bank’s funds. The
details of that struggle may never be known, but the
circumstances tell plainly that Cashier Hathaway either
surprised the assassin in the dark closet, where he had
perhaps concealed himself to await an opportunity to
work upon the combination of the safe, or had himself
been surprised while about to close the door of the
vault.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The crime was committed in the vicinity of 8 p.m.,
and its early discovery—within less than half an hour
thereafter, indeed—singularly enough was due to a letter
which the murdered cashier had previously sent to the
president of the bank, requesting his immediate presence
to confer on a business matter. The president, the Hon.
Cyrus Felton, upon returning to his residence shortly
after 8 o’clock, found a note from Cashier Hathaway
asking him to call at the bank at once. The note had
been left by a messenger, the servant stated, about fifteen
minutes before. Mr. Felton hastily repaired to the bank,
about ten minutes’ walk. He found the outer door ajar,
but the door to the cashier’s private office was locked.
This was not unusual, and, presuming that the cashier
was busy within, Mr. Felton used his own key and
opened the door without knocking. Then the awful discovery
of the murder was made.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Cashier Hathaway lay face downward in front of the
open safe door, his right arm partially drawn up beneath
the body and his heavy oaken desk chair overturned
near by. His first thought being that the cashier had
fallen in a shock, Mr. Felton hastened to raise the recumbent
form. As he turned the body over, the soft
rays from the argand lamp on the cashier’s desk revealed
an ominous pool upon the polished floor, even now
augmented by the slight moving of the body. Roger
Hathaway lay weltering in his own blood, slowly oozing
from a bullet hole directly over the heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It was several moments before Mr. Felton could pull
himself together to take cognizance of the circumstances.
He then noted the unmistakable evidences of a desperate
struggle. As stated, the cashier’s own chair lay overturned
near the body; one of the side drawers in the
desk was partially drawn out, and the orderly row of
directors’ chairs were now disarranged as if a heavy body
had been flung violently against them. The door of the
dark closet was wide open and a lot of old ledgers that
had been piled upon its floor were toppled over into the
room. The doors of the safe were open, and a glance
within revealed the principal money drawer half-withdrawn,
and empty save of two canvas bags of specie and
nickels; a goodly bunch of keys with chain attached
hanging in the lock. The story was told. Cashier Hathaway
had been murdered and the bank robbed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Felton immediately notified Sheriff Wilson, and
the legal machinery of the town was at once set in
motion to encompass the capture of the murderer and
robber. It was thought that with the short start obtained
the feat would be a comparatively easy matter.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nearly $50,000 in available cash, and half as much
more in securities, part negotiable and part worthless to
the robber, were secured by the murderer. The presence
of this unusually large amount of ready money was due
to the fact that $50,000 of Mansfield County bonds matured
to-day and were payable at the Raymond National
Bank.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The presence of Cashier Hathaway in the bank at that
particular time was by the merest chance, and the conclusion
is therefore irresistible that the murder was not
premeditated. The savings and national banks, though
both among the most prosperous and stable fiduciary
institutions in the state, are comparatively small, the
capital of the national bank being $50,000 and employing
but a small clerical force. The latter comprise, besides
the cashier, the teller of the bank, Frederick Sibley; the
bookkeeper of the savings bank, Ralph Felton, son of the
president, and one clerk, a youth named Edward Maxwell.
For the last two weeks the teller, Mr. Sibley, has
been confined to his residence by illness, and considerable
extra labor has necessarily devolved upon the
cashier. Memorial Day, a legal holiday in Vermont, the
bank had been closed, and on returning from the services
at the cemetery, in which he had taken part—for Mr.
Hathaway had been a gallant soldier in the famous Vermont
brigade—the cashier had dropped into the bank,
apparently to complete some work upon the books. It
is possible that the robber—the opinion is general that
there was but one engaged in the enterprise—had previously
entered the bank, and upon the entrance of the
cashier concealed himself in the only place available,
the dark closet. He may have remained an unobserved
spectator of the cashier through the partly opened door
and as the latter finished his work and prepared to close
the safe, the robber may have concluded, by a coup de
main, to save himself the trouble of attempting to solve
the combination, and, noiselessly stepping from the
closet, have sought to surprise the cashier. On this
hypothesis the presumption is that Mr. Hathaway became
aware of his danger, and turning sought to ward off the
blow, when the struggle ensued that was ended with his
death. Or the cashier may have discovered the presence
of some intruder in the closet, and seizing his revolver,
which he kept in a drawer of his desk, he may have
approached the closet, when the robber sprung upon him
and, wresting the weapon from the feeble hands of the
old banker, turned it against the latter’s breast.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The fatal shot was fired at so close range that the
clothing of the victim was scorched by the explosion.
No weapon was found in the room; the revolver which,
as noted above, the cashier was known to have kept in
his desk, is also missing. The wound was made, the
physicians state, by a 32-caliber bullet, which penetrated
the breast directly above the vital organ, and death must
have been instantaneous. The shot was fired at about
8 o’clock. Prof. Black, who occupies rooms directly over
the cashier’s office, heard a shot at that time, as did several
friends who were in the room with him, but they
attributed it to boys shooting water rats from the bridge
beneath the professor’s window.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Thus far the tragedy possesses few extraordinary features.
But what has become of the murderer? Raymond
is not so populous that the presence of a stranger
would be unnoted. Yet no one has volunteered information
of any suspicious characters in town. Within fifty
minutes of the commission of a daring crime the perpetrator
disappeared, leaving not a trace for the local
sleuths. The last seen of Mr. Hathaway alive, so far as
known, was about 7:45 o’clock, when he stepped to the
door of the bank, and, calling a boy who was standing
on the bridge, throwing stones into the stream, asked him
to take a letter to President Felton at his house. Half an
hour later he was found shot through the heart in his
office.</p>

<p class='c014'>“President Felton was seen by the Hemisphere representative
to-day, and told the story of the finding of the
dead cashier substantially as outlined above. He was
terribly affected by the tragedy and could hardly be induced
to converse regarding it.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Roger Hathaway was one of the best known and
highly esteemed residents of Raymond. He was 63 years
of age and had been identified with the national and
savings banks ever since their organization, the last
twenty years as cashier and treasurer respectively. He
was prominent in Grand Army and church circles; a
deacon in the Congregational Church. Of a severely
stern but eminently just disposition, it was not known
that Deacon Hathaway possessed an enemy in the world.
He lived in a plain but substantial mansion, the family
homestead of several generations of Hathaways, with his
two daughters, his wife having died some ten years before.
He was one of the founders of both the savings and
national banks, which under his management had prospered
to an unusual degree and stood high among the
banking institutions of the state. He had held several
important positions in the gift of his townspeople, and as
town treasurer his rugged honesty, economic conservatism
and strict observance of the letter of the law in the
handling of the town’s funds, had earned for him the
sobriquet of ‘watchdog of the treasury,’ a title which he
sealed even with his life blood.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Up to a late hour this evening no clew to the murderer
has been discovered. The theory is held by the
local police that the deed was clearly that of an expert
bank robber, and they are inclined to think that he may
be a member of the same gang that has broken into
numerous postoffices in New Hampshire and Vermont
within the last few months. The officials cite the fact that
the local papers had advertised that $50,000 in Mansfield
County bonds were to be redeemed at the Raymond
National Bank upon this particular date, and the natural
presumption that the bank would have on hand a large
amount of currency, with the knowledge that yesterday
was a holiday, when the bank would be closed and afford
an unusual opportunity to work upon the safe, would
form a strong inducement to a daring burglar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Raymond, Vt., June 1.—A startling sequel to the
murder of Cashier Hathaway and the robbery of the Raymond
National and Wild River Savings Banks was developed
to-day in the mysterious disappearance of Miss
Helen Hathaway, the younger daughter of the dead
banker, and Derrick Ames, a well-known young man
of Raymond.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ames is about 27 years old, and occupied a responsible
and lucrative position in the local office of the Vermont
Life Insurance Company. While not possessing a
positive reputation for evil, Ames was regarded askance
by the more staid and conservative residents of the town,
and his position socially was somewhat anomalous. He
had resided in Raymond some five or six years and was
known to have been a warm admirer of Miss Hathaway.
But it was equally apparent to the gossip-loving townspeople
that Deacon Hathaway regarded the young insurance
clerk with distinct disfavor, and had forbidden his
daughter’s continuing the intimacy. It was likewise
well known that the missing girl had frequently met
Ames clandestinely.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Neither Miss Hathaway nor Derrick Ames was seen
after the discovery of the bank tragedy. Ames was at
his boarding house at noon on the day of the murder,
but did not return to supper. His room, with all his
effects, was left as usual and gave no indication that he
contemplated a hasty departure. Even at the office where
he was employed he left some personal effects and half a
month’s salary was to his credit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“In the case of Miss Hathaway, also, there are absolutely
no indications of premeditated departure. Her
sister states that she has taken not even a wrap, only the
clothes she wore that afternoon as she left the house.
Neither man nor maiden was seen by any person to leave
Raymond. No vehicle was secured for either of them,
and no one answering their description boarded the train
at the Raymond Station. They have disappeared as completely,
as suddenly and as mysteriously as did the murderer
of Cashier Hathaway.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The knowledge of these circumstances has intensified
the excitement occasioned by the murder and robbery.
The coincidence, if it be but a coincidence, of the unpremeditated
elopement of Helen Hathaway upon the very
day, nay, perhaps the very hour, that her aged father
was stricken by the bullet of the assassin, is sufficiently
startling of itself to cause the most intense excitement.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Is there any connection between the disappearance
of Derrick Ames and Helen Hathaway and the shooting
of Cashier Hathaway and the subsequent looting of the
bank vault? Why did the couple, if they simply ran
away to get married without the parental sanction, do so
manifestly on the spur of the moment, without any prearranged
plans, without notification to even their intimate
friends? And why, if they went innocently away,
have they failed to acquaint any one with their present
whereabouts, when they must be aware of the cruel murder
of Miss Hathaway’s good father, the details of which
have been published far and wide, not only in the provincial
newspapers, but throughout the metropolitan
press?</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is not a resident of Raymond who will hint at
even the possibility of any guilty knowledge of the taking-off
of her father by Helen Hathaway, before or during
her hurried flight. For although regarded as unusually
high-spirited and impetuous, she was loving and lovable
to a degree and the idol of her sister. The only indiscretion
that can be attributed to the missing girl was her
occasional meetings with Derrick Ames without the sanction
of her father.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Her companion in flight, on the other hand, was not
especially favorably known in Raymond. While he
came to the town with excellent credentials, he was not
a favorite in any particular set or society. Handsome in
face and figure, an athlete of considerable local repute,
with alternate moods of extreme depression and satirical
good humor, he was such a one as might be expected to
turn the head of a romantic young girl like the absent
Miss Hathaway. Ames was free with his money, and
while not a drinking man, in the sense of the term in
this part of the country, he occasionally wooed the wine
cup with great energy and originality. He had enemies
in plenty and but a week before the tragedy had abruptly
resigned the lieutenancy of the Raymond Rifles because
of a trifling disagreement with the captain. It must be
stated, however, that no mean or ignoble act or petty
crime had ever been attributed to him, the chief cause of
his unpopularity proceeding from his reserve, the sharpness
of his tongue and the irascibility of his temper.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Had Derrick Ames disappeared alone, on the evening
of the murder, there would have been but one opinion as
to his guilt or innocence. But the unaccountable flight
of Miss Hathaway—this is the one flaw in the chain of
circumstantial evidence. Some people will explain this
away on the universal theory for every inexplicable
action of the human mind—hypnotism. It is said that
Ames placed Miss Hathaway within the spell of his own
powerful will, and unknowingly, unwittingly, blindly
obedient, beautiful Helen Hathaway accompanied the
cold-blooded slayer of her own father in his flight from
the scene of his crime.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Did Ames and Miss Hathaway leave Raymond together?
While there is no evidence that they did, the
presumption is so strong as to compel the inference.
In any event Raymond has practically convicted Derrick
Ames of complicity, if not actual participation, in the
murder of Roger Hathaway.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is possible that the murder was not premeditated,
as was intimated in these dispatches yesterday. Ames
may have called upon the cashier at the bank, to plead
again his suit for the hand of Helen Hathaway. A blunt
refusal, hasty words, a bitter quarrel, Ames’ temper,
quick and ungovernable, a brief struggle, the fatal shot
and the older man lay dead upon the floor. What more
natural than that the young murderer, fully appreciating
his terrible situation, and cognizant of the large amount
of ready money in the safe, should wrench the familiar
bunch of keys from the pocket of the dead cashier and
possess himself of the treasure? It requires something of
a stretch of the imagination to fancy the assassin, his
hand yet reeking with the blood of her father, inducing
the young girl to accompany him in his flight for life and
liberty, yet it is not impossible—and in the belief of
many it is just what Derrick Ames did do.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is but the faintest possible clew as yet to connect
any one else with the crime. Besides a few hotel
arrivals—commercial men comparatively well known—one
stranger, and one only, is believed to have been in
Raymond on the day of the murder. No one saw him
come, no one saw him leave the town. Inquiry was
made at the depot, the telegraph operator states, shortly
after 8 o’clock, as to the time of departure of the next
train south. The operator did not notice the questioner
particularly, although he is positive he was a stranger
in Raymond.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The theory of a prearranged plot to rob the bank on
the night the cashier was shot has been assiduously
worked by the local authorities. It was known that there
would be a large amount of money in the bank on the
night preceding the paying off of the matured county
bonds. Was it not worth while for an organized gang of
bank robbers to plan a descent on the Raymond institution?
Was it not possible that they did so plan; that
they had already secured access to the banking-room
while the populace was watching the parade in the afternoon;
that they were awaiting the cover of darkness to
begin work upon the safe, when all unexpectedly the
cashier arrived and entered the bank; that the robbers
retreated to the dark closet; that here they remained hidden
while Mr. Hathaway performed some pressing work
upon the books, meanwhile sending the note requesting
the presence of the president; that while he stepped to
the front door to secure a messenger for the letter the
robbers may have conceived the daring scheme of seizing
the cash drawer from the vault; that the cashier returned
while they were in the very act of executing their design;
that he rushed to his desk and had already possessed
himself of his revolver, when he was seized by the robbers
and shot dead before he could succeed in making
use of his own weapon, which was subsequently picked
up and carried off by the robbers?</p>

<p class='c014'>“More careful investigations of the scene of the murder
developed the fact that the struggle between the
cashier and his assailant, or assailants, must have been not
only a severe one, but of several minutes’ duration.
There were marks of violence on the body of the dead
banker, the physicians report, which must have been
made by an exceptionally strong man. The right wrist
showed quite severe abrasions, as if it had been grasped
fiercely by a strong hand, and on the other side of the
wrist was a purple mark that was evidently made by
a seal ring pressed into the flesh by the tremendous force
with which the hand had been seized. The snow-white
and abundant hair of Mr. Hathaway was also disheveled,
when the body was first discovered, and the chain to
which his bunch of keys had been attached was snapped
off, only about two inches remaining upon his person.
No signs of a weapon or any burglarious tools were discovered
in or about the bank premises, but evidence of
the extreme coolness and sang-froid of the murderer is
afforded by the fact that, apparently in searching for
suitable paper in which to wrap the big package of bills
two or three full pages of the big bank ledger were torn
out and used for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nothing was missing from the person of the dead
man, except, singularly enough, a curiously fashioned
locket which Mr. Hathaway wore as a watch charm.
It contained miniatures of his two daughters, Louise and
Helen. No reason for its being carried off is apparent.
The link which held it to the watch-chain was broken as
if the locket had been violently removed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The exact amount of money stolen cannot as yet
be stated. President Felton alleges that, until the trial
balance is drawn off, it will be impossible to give figures.
Certainly not less than $40,000 in greenbacks was
secured, and probably half as much more in securities,
which, however, are not negotiable and are therefore
worthless to the robbers. The bank is perfectly solvent,
President Felton states, and will resume business at an
early date.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Mr. Felton is well-nigh prostrated by the shock of
his awful discovery on the evening of Memorial Day and
has aged visibly in the last two days. He does not attach
so much importance to the dual disappearance of Derrick
Ames and Helen Hathaway as do most of the citizens,
and expresses the opinion that it is a simple elopement
and that the couple will return shortly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The directors of the savings and national banks, at a
meeting this morning, authorized the offer of a reward of
$4,000 for the capture and conviction of the murderer or
murderers, in addition to the purse of $1,000 ‘hung up’
by the town.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The coroner’s inquest will be begun to-morrow.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE CORONER’S INQUEST.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>For a town the size of Raymond, 3,000-odd inhabitants,
the Mansfield County court house is an unusually
large and commodious structure. But the spacious room
is not nearly adequate to the demands of the pushing
crowd that seeks admittance to the inquest that has been
summoned by Coroner Lord to sit upon the body of the
dead cashier, Roger Hathaway. George Demeritt, the
town’s sole day police force, is literally swept off his feet
by the surging assemblage, and in less than five minutes
after the throwing open of the doors the room is a
solid mass of perspiring humanity.</p>

<p class='c011'>With much difficulty Sheriff Wilson makes a passage
for the dozen witnesses under his charge, the crowd gazing,
with the sympathetic impudence of an inquest audience,
at the statuesque form of Miss Hathaway, heavily
veiled, and the bowed figure of President Felton of the
Raymond Bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>The jury selected by Coroner Lord files in from the
judges’ room, and after the customary preliminaries the
autopsy performed by Drs. Robinson and Dodge is read
by the latter. The document, stripped of its verbiage
and medical terms, alleges that Roger Hathaway died
from a bullet wound, the leaden missile having entered
the left breast almost directly over the heart, and that
death must have been instantaneous. There were signs
of violence on the person of the dead man, a severe contusion
on the forehead that might have been inflicted by a
blow or might have been caused by the fall to the floor.
There were also slight abrasions on the right wrist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Dodge states, in reply to an inquiry from the coroner,
that Mr. Hathaway had probably been dead an hour
when he reached his side. Rigor mortis had not begun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Cyrus Felton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a craning of necks in the court room as the
coroner calls to his feet the aged bank president. Jack
Ashley, who is sitting at the lawyers’ table, jotting down
a few notes, begins to take a lively interest in the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton slowly walks to the witness stand. That he
is greatly moved even the least observant in the throng
can but notice, and his hand trembles visibly as he
replaces his pince-nez and turns to face Coroner Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>The usual formal questions as to his acquaintance with
the dead man, his connection with the bank, etc., are
asked and answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I visited the bank in response to a note which I found
when I returned home from my—from the postoffice,”
Mr. Felton states.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The note was from Mr. Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And its contents?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The note merely said: ‘Come to the bank immediately.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you the note with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I tore it up,” replies Mr. Felton, and the expression
which accompanies his words is noted by Ashley,
who is scanning narrowly the countenance of the banker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The note had been left at my house a short while
before I returned home, my servant tells me,” proceeds
Mr. Felton. “I went at once to the bank.” The witness
has grown so agitated that he is obliged to seat himself,
and his voice is hardly audible in the stilled room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The front door was slightly ajar and I walked through
the bank to the directors’ room. The door to this apartment
was locked; I unlocked it and entered. Mr. Hathaway
lay face downward in the middle of the floor, I
should think. I thought he might have fallen in a shock
and went to lift him up, when I saw the blood. I felt
for his pulse, but there was no motion.” The voice of
the witness breaks as he utters these words and he covers
his face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were there any evidences of a struggle?” the coroner
asks, after a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Mr. Hathaway’s office chair was overturned
and the directors’ chairs were disarranged. One of the
drawers in Mr. Hathaway’s desk had been pulled so far
out that it had dropped to the floor and the contents
were spilled. A lot of old ledgers that had been piled in
the closet were toppled over into the room. I glanced
into the closet and then turned my attention to the open
vault. I found the cash drawer in the safe withdrawn
and empty except for a couple of canvas bags of silver
and nickels. I then hastened to find Sheriff Wilson.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What hour was it when you entered the bank?” asks
Coroner Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>“About 8:20 o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And at what time did you notify Sheriff Wilson?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton hesitates a moment and glances inquiringly
at that official. “It did not seem more than a minute
that I spent in the bank. But I was so shocked—and
I—and I stopped to gather up the papers on the floor—perhaps
it was five minutes before I got to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you notice any weapons on the floor of the cashier’s
room?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What amount of money do you estimate was stolen
from the safe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>President Felton debates a moment, as if making a
mental calculation, and replies: “At least $37,000 in
currency and gold, and some securities. The exact
amount of the latter we cannot tell until we have listed
our papers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is all, Mr. Felton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A suppressed murmur of intense interest runs around
the crowded room as Louise Hathaway takes the witness
stand. As she raises the veil that has concealed her features
the townspeople marveled at the composure her
marble countenance evinces. Ashley glances at her with
interest and draws a long breath. “Gad! she’s a beauty,”
he decides, and then drops his eyes as they encounter
the calm gaze of the witness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her father left the house to go to the bank about 6:30
o’clock, Miss Hathaway testifies. Tea was served at 6
o’clock. Her sister Helen had not returned at that time,
but at her father’s request they had not waited the tea,
because he said he had some work to do at the bank.
It was an unusual thing for him to go to the bank evenings,
but the illness of the teller had necessitated extra
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hathaway, do you know where your sister is?”
The silence in the court room is intense as the coroner
asks the question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My sister did not return that afternoon,” declares
Miss Hathaway, after a brief pause. “I have reason to
think that she has gone with Mr. Ames to be married.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you do not know where they now are?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway shakes her head, as her fingers clasp
and unclasp nervously in her lap. The ordeal is a trying
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When did you last see your sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About 2 o’clock in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when did you last see Mr. Ames?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A slight flush replaces the pallor for a moment; then
as suddenly recedes, leaving her paler than before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not seen Mr. Ames for a fortnight,” she replies
in a tone barely audible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did your sister indicate to you her intention of eloping?”
is the next question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had no reason to think that she contemplated a
clandestine marriage. But I should prefer not to discuss
the matter further, Mr. Lord,” says the witness, in
evident agitation. “I am sure Helen’s departure can have
no possible connection with—with that awful deed. It
was only an unfortunate coincidence that they went away
on that afternoon. I—I am sure they will return in due
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Coroner Lord glances irresolutely at the state’s attorney,
and after a moment’s deliberation permits Miss
Hathaway to retire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sheriff Wilson, the next witness, describes minutely the
appearance of the bank and vault and of the body of
the dead cashier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sarah Johnson, the maid at Mr. Felton’s residence, testifies
that the note referred to by Mr. Felton was left at
the house shortly before 8 o’clock by a lad named Jimmie
Howe. A few minutes later a stranger inquired for Mr.
Felton at the house. There is a slight buzz of excitement
among the audience at this first mention of the
presence of a stranger in the village on the evening of
the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know he was a stranger?” sharply inquires
the coroner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the reason that when I asked him which Mr.
Felton he wished to see he replied that he did not know
there were two Mr. Feltons.” That evidence is conclusive.
It is, so far as the audience is concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He asked where he could find Mr. Felton, and I told
him perhaps at his office in the bank building,” continues
Sarah.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Johnson is closely questioned as to the demeanor
of the stranger, but she knows little of importance, as she
had not seen the visitor’s face. He was of medium
height, she says, and his voice was pleasant. Sheriff
Wilson, who has first learned of this clew, smiles patronizingly
upon Ashley and the other newspaper men.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bright-faced lad of 12 is Jimmie Howe, whom Coroner
Lord next calls to the stand. Jimmie was playing
on the bridge when Mr. Hathaway called to him from
the bank door and asked him to take a note to Mr.
Felton and to hurry about it. After he delivered the note
he went home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prof. George Black, Edward Knapp and three others,
who were in Prof. Black’s room in the bank building,
testify to hearing a shot about 8 o’clock, but whether
before or after that hour they cannot agree.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alden Heath, the telegraph operator at the depot,
stated that some one—he was busy at his key at the time—asked
somewhere around 8 o’clock when the next train
left. He answered without looking up, and when he
did glance at the window the inquirer was gone. It was
a strange voice; of that he was positive.</p>

<p class='c011'>George Kenney, who states that he is the station
agent at Ashfield, is next sworn. His testimony establishes
the probable fact that Derrick Ames and Helen
Hathaway boarded the midnight train for New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is an involuntary but quickly suppressed exclamation
from the witnesses. Miss Hathaway is trembling
and Ralph Felton, who is sitting near her, is savagely
biting his mustache.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Coroner Lord calls the name of Richard Chase and
the stalwart warden of the State prison at Windsor
appears on the witness stand there is a hush of expectancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ernest Stanley, a convict in the Vermont State prison,
was released at noon of Memorial Day,” Warden Chase
says succinctly. “He asked for and was given a ticket
to Raymond, and left on the north-bound afternoon
train. He was five feet ten inches in height, of medium
build, dark complexion, smooth face, and had closely
cropped dark hair. He wore a light tweed suit and a
straw hat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Mr. Chase concludes his testimony the coroner
consults for a few moments with the state’s attorney and
then summons Ralph Felton, son of President Felton,
and the bookkeeper of the Wild River Savings Bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the young man steps to the stand Ashley glances
at him interestedly, and after a good look decides that
he does not like him. There is a certain shiftiness of eye
that the New Yorker does not fancy, and the notes which
he takes of the witness’ testimony are nearly verbatim.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Felton answers in the briefest phrases the questions
of the coroner. He had seen no strangers in the
bank in the last few days. He had last seen Mr. Hathaway
the afternoon before the tragedy, when the bank
closed for the day. On the afternoon of Memorial
Day—</p>

<p class='c011'>The witness stops abruptly and a flush overspreads his
features as he nervously bites his tawny mustache.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the afternoon of Memorial Day,” invites the coroner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was around town as usual,” finishes Felton.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some reason the momentary hesitation of the witness
apparently impresses Mr. Lord, and he seems disposed
to make minute inquiry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where did you say you were on the afternoon of
Memorial Day?” he again interrogates.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ralph Felton looks straight at the coroner an instant,
and then his gaze wanders over the stilled room and
finally rests upon his father, who, roused from the impassive
attitude in which he has sunk after completing his
own testimony, casts a startled look upon his son.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sudden hush that has involuntarily accompanied
Mr. Lord’s question is intensified, as father and son gaze
at each other, apparently oblivious of the unanswered
coroner.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>FATHER AND SON.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>An almost imperceptible raising of the eyebrows by
the elder man, and Ralph Felton turns quickly to the
coroner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Really, Mr. Lord, I cannot furnish a detailed statement
of my every movement during the last week,” he
says, nonchalantly. “I witnessed the procession, or at
least the local post, on its way to the depot to meet the
Ruggbury contingent, and later went to the Exchange
for dinner. In the afternoon I was in the billiard room
of the hotel, and I believe I visited the postoffice in the
evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What time did you last see Mr. Hathaway?” The
persistence of the coroner in questioning the bookkeeper
is inexplicable to the audience, who have not observed
the little slips of paper that State’s Attorney Brown has
passed along the table to Mr. Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>“About noon on the day of the murder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ralph Felton is for the first time manifesting signs of
impatience. “He was in the bank. I went to get something
which I had left there, and while I was there Mr.
Hathaway came in. I left him there and a short time
afterward saw him in the procession.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Felton, where were you between 7:45 and 8:30
o’clock the evening of Tuesday?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A dull red replaces the slight pallor on the face of the
young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Lord, I cannot say where I was during that particular
time. I have my own personal reasons—not connected
with this case, I assure you—for not desiring to
answer your question.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The murmur which has begun to overspread the room
is quickly but only temporarily hushed as the coroner
announces:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The inquest is adjourned until to-morrow morning at
9 o’clock.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>“You know why I did not answer Coroner Lord’s
question. I am tired of this hypocrisy. I simply will not
go on the stand again—and that settles it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the richly furnished library of Cyrus Felton’s
home the inquisition so abruptly broken off by Coroner
Lord has been resumed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The president of the Raymond National Bank now
bears little resemblance to the bowed old man who, with
trembling lips and pallid brow, testified regarding the
murder of Cashier Hathaway a few hours before. There
is an angry flush upon his face and a stern setting
of the chin that causes one straight line to mark the
location of his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the last defiant words of his son a spasm as of
sudden pain for a moment distorts his patriarchal face,
and his hand involuntarily presses his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to leave Raymond—at once—to-night.
Leave as Derrick Ames left,” continued Ralph Felton,
with an imprecation. “It’s no use talking. My mind is
made up and you should be the last man to urge me
to remain. You know—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ralph, this is madness,” interrupts his father. “There
can be no necessity for your leaving town, least of all
while matters are as they are. The bank—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bank needs both of us—I don’t think,” rejoins
the younger man flippantly. “As the boodle is gone
I guess you can get along without a bookkeeper for a
time—maybe forever. But go I shall, and money I must
have. Oh, I know what you are going to say,” as Mr.
Felton opens his lips. “It doesn’t make any difference
where it has gone. Suffice it to say, it is planted. If you
have ever had any experience with—but here it is getting
on toward 11 o’clock, and at 12:10 I must take the Montreal
express. I don’t propose to board it here. I shall
drive to South Ashfield. Now, understand me, father,”
as Cyrus Felton again seeks to interrupt him, “it is just
as much for your interest for me to be a couple of thousand
miles from Raymond as it is mine. It is bound to
come out—why, what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Once again that ashen pallor accompanies a spasm of
severest pain, and this time Cyrus Felton emits a slight
groan as his fingers sink into the heavily upholstered
arms of the sleepy-hollow chair into which he has sunk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing—nothing but a pleurisy attack,” he faintly
replies.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is silence for a moment, broken only by the
sonorous ticking of the mantel clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the money?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ralph, you know that I can ill afford to spare any
considerable amount just now. But your safety must, of
course, be considered, and I will endeavor to send you
funds later. What I can spare now ought to be sufficient
to start life anew in some western city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ralph Felton smiles sardonically as his father steps
to the little safe set in the wall, and, moving the screen
from the front, turns the combination. He lounges
toward the receptacle, and, leaning on the screen, gazes
down at his father, who has withdrawn one of the two
drawers which the safe boasts and is running over a
package of bills. The contents of the lower drawer are
exposed by the withdrawal of the upper one, and the
light from the chandelier is reflected back from some
shining substance in the till. It catches young Felton’s
eye and his long arm passes over the stooping figure of
his father and picks the gleaming metal from the drawer.
It is a loaded revolver of the bull-dog variety, 32 caliber,
and one chamber has been discharged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton raises his head. The shining little engine
of destruction in the clasp of his son is almost before and
on a level with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a shudder the elder man turns his head and
slowly and laboriously rises to his feet. He seems to
have suddenly aged even in the last few moments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ralph Felton examines the revolver critically, looks at
his father’s averted face, and, without speaking, lays the
weapon in the drawer. There is silence in the room,
broken at last by the almost apologetic tones of the father.
“How will you reach South Ashfield?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Sam must drive me over with the mare. I will
start him up now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As his son leaves the room Cyrus Felton sinks into
an easy-chair and his head drops upon his bosom. Who
can tell the thoughts that surge through his troubled
mind at the moment? The clatter of hoofs on the concrete
driveway beside the window arouses him from his
reverie, and a moment later Ralph Felton enters, a
satchel in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, father, Sam is ready and I must go. We shall
have little more than an hour to make the ten miles and
catch the express. Good-by; it is all right, sir; believe
me, father,” the younger man drops his disengaged hand
not unkindly on the other’s shoulder, “my sudden departure
will do nobody here any harm, and least of all
will it affect you. One thing I will say; I will find the
scoundrel who took Helen Hathaway from Raymond, if
he is above ground, and when we meet he will have
occasion to remember that time.” Ralph Felton’s face
is darkened by a savage scowl as he speaks, and he raises
a clenched fist with a gesture so suggestive that his
father involuntarily steps back. “Yes, I have two objects
in cutting the town. One reason you know, the other
is to seek and find the hound who has stolen Helen
Hathaway from me. I cared for her as I shall never
love another woman, and I meant to have her. Now—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The musical chime of the clock begins to strike the
hour. Ralph Felton seizes the package of bills that lies
upon the table and places it in an inner pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will return sometime, father, when this bank affair
has ceased to be a subject of investigation,” he says, with
his hand on the door-knob. “Good-by. Just keep a stiff
upper lip and you’ll be all right. I’m off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The outer door closes with a sharp click and a moment
later the impatient stamping of hoofs is succeeded by
the even footfalls of the fastest mare in Mansfield County.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the sound grows fainter and fainter Cyrus Felton
suddenly starts as if aroused from a stupor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did I let him go? Idiot that I am! It is madness—worse
than madness. It is confession. Am I
losing my senses, that I did not insist upon his remaining
and completing his testimony? At the worst it could
never be proved. The wages of sin! The wages of sin!”
he groans, as he sinks back in his chair and buries his
face in his hands.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Ralph Felton to the stand,” orders Coroner Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>As on the preceding day, the court room is packed
with the people of Raymond. There is a craning of
necks toward the settees reserved for witnesses. Ralph
Felton is not there, and there is a death-like stillness as
Coroner Lord again calls this now most interesting of
witnesses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Coroner!” The lank figure of the station agent
at South Ashfield elevates itself above the crowd. “If
it please your honor, Ralph Felton boarded the Montreal
express at South Ashfield last night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course there is a sensation, a murmur of voices that
the coroner quickly checks. The few remaining witnesses
are unimportant and the inquest is adjourned until
afternoon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A PROPOSITION OF PARTNERSHIP.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The usual congress of village gossips is in session
to-night at the Exchange hotel. It is the fourth day
since the Raymond Bank affair, and the details of the
tragedy are discussed with an animation and a wealth of
clew that brings a smile to the face of John Barker, the
New York detective, who retreats to a quiet corner of the
hotel veranda to finish his cigar and muse upon the
affair with the calm contemplation characteristic of men
in his calling.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective’s face expresses a shade of annoyance as
Jack Ashley ascends the steps to the veranda, draws a
chair opposite his, lights a cigar and tilts his seat back
at a comfortable angle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are John Barker, the detective,” began Ashley.
Barker assents with a nod.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t a card with me, but my name is Jack Ashley,
and I am attached to the staff of the New York
Hemisphere.” Barker looks duly impressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are an ordinary detective, I presume?” Barker
stares. “What I mean is, if you will pardon my frankness,
you are not a Sherlock Holmes or a M. Lecocq?”
It is apparent from his face that the detective is in doubt
whether to laugh or express his displeasure. He compromises
with a faint smile and accepts the proffered
cigar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My reason for asking,” goes on Ashley, “is that I
have a proposition to offer you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker strikes a match to touch off his weed. “That
proposition is—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That we work this bank case together.” Barker
drops the lighted match and gazes at his new acquaintance
in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have another match,” remarks the other, passing
it over.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective lights his cigar and puffs away on it for
some moments in silence. “I am not in the habit of
taking in partners,” he observes finally.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always take a deep interest in an affair like the
Hathaway case,” resumes Ashley, without reference to
the other’s remark. “In fact, my special line on the
Hemisphere has been the running down of mysterious
crimes. I have trailed quite a number of them, and you
will pardon my egotism when I say I have been quite
successful in my dual capacity of sleuth and newspaper
man.” Barker looks a trifle bored.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be candid, however, this case is a bit too big for
me to handle alone. It spreads out too much. It is too
much of a job for one man to look after.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed?” The irony in the detective’s voice is thinly
veiled. He says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then on the strength of your intimation that you are
a devilish clever fellow—you will pardon my frankness
this time—I am asked to take in an assistant who will
gladly share with me the $5,000 reward in the event of
the murderer being apprehended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I sha’n’t bother about the reward. I am simply
looking for glory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are young in the newspaper business?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About twelve years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And looking for glory?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley laughs. “For my paper; not for myself.” He
passes over a telegram received that day. It read as
follows:</p>
<p class='c015'><b>“Jack Ashley, Raymond, Vt.: Work up case at any expense,
and discover murderer if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chambers.”</b></p>
<p class='c010'>“Now,” says Ashley, as he replaces the dispatch in his
pocket, “I will tell you why I think it would be to your
advantage to join forces with me.” Barker evinces
some interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am in possession of some facts which you not only
do not know, but are not likely to get hold of unless I
enlighten you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” The detective draws his chair nearer his companion
and glances about to make sure there are no
outside listeners.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I finish, if you consider my information as valuable
as I appraise it, you can do as you please about
the partnership idea. At any rate you will be so much
ahead. Come up to my room. We will not be disturbed
there.” When they are comfortably seated and fresh
cigars lighted Ashley begins his story.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have run onto two clews. One of them I consider
important; the other less so. By the way, how long
have you been in town? Come in on the after-dinner
train?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I have acquainted myself with the known facts
in the case and the result of the coroner’s inquest. Deceased
came to his death at the hands of some person
unknown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But who will be known ere long. But to resume.
As you know, a man called at the house of Cyrus
Felton shortly before 8 o’clock of the night of the killing.
To the inquiry of the housemaid as to which Mr. Felton
was wanted the man replied that he ‘did not know there
were two.’ Not long after 8 o’clock that same evening
a man appeared at the ticket office of the railroad station
and inquired when the next train left. These incidents,
while not startling in themselves, seem to prove that in
each case the questioner was a stranger to Raymond.
Every one around these parts knows that there are two
Feltons, father and son, and the natives are also presumed
to know that there is no night train through the
town before 11:50.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well reasoned,” remarks Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As you also know, on the afternoon of Memorial Day
a chap named Ernest Stanley was liberated from the
State prison at Windsor, after serving two of a three
years’ sentence for forgery. Despite the fact that Raymond
was not his home and that he had not, so far as
known, a friend or acquaintance in the place, and contrary
to the advice of the warden, who took an interest
in the fellow, he bought a ticket to this town and started
north on the afternoon train. That latter fact was proved
by the ticket agent at Windsor, who sold him the ticket
and saw him board the train. I went to Windsor this
forenoon, after the inquest, saw a photograph of this
Stanley, and secured a pretty accurate description of
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there is no evidence that he left the train at this
station. Or if he did—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He could have been, as I believe he was, the visitor
at Felton’s house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not so sure of that,” contends the detective. “On
the evening of Memorial Day the agent of a granite manufacturers’
journal, published at Chicago, stopped at this
hotel. He arrived on the afternoon train from the north,
and after supper, the clerk told me when I quizzed him,
he inquired where Cyrus Felton lived. Felton, you
know, is the principal owner in the Wild River Granite
Quarries. It is more than likely, is it not, that he was
the visitor at the Felton residence?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Still he may not have called that night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True. Admitting the caller to have been Stanley,
what then? A motive must be assigned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will discuss that later. For the present suffice it
to be known that Stanley was sentenced to State prison
for forging the name of Cyrus Felton two years ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what of it? If Stanley’s thoughts were of
revenge they were apparently directed against Felton,
not the man who was murdered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is precisely the point that is not clear to me,”
confesses Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, listen. Here’s a proposition for you: If Stanley
was not concerned in the bank affair, what was he
doing at 6 o’clock next morning asleep in the bushes in
a lonely gorge near South Ashfield village?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The devil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With a package of papers clutched fast in his hands,
about the size that a bundle of treasury notes and securities
would make.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know he was there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I met him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker is thoughtful. “You said nothing to the authorities
or in your dispatches about the incident?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I didn’t consider it worth while. The authorities
were already scouring the country round about, and
I did not exploit it in my dispatches because I concluded
to save it for a longer and better story when we run down
the criminal—beg pardon, when the criminal is run
down. But,” continues Ashley, as Barker remains silent,
“that is the clew to which I attach the less importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had heard from some source that Ralph Felton had
been seen at this hotel a good share of Memorial Day,
and I started in on a pumping expedition, beginning
with John Thayer, the clerk. Thayer was noticeably
uncommunicative; I thought I’d bluff him a bit, so I
remarked: ‘Well, you’ve concluded to tell me what you
know, eh?’ The bluff appeared to work, for he flushed
a little and replied: ‘I’ll tell you all about it if you will
agree to keep it out of the paper.’ As I had suspended
all dispatches to the Hemisphere pending the discovery
of a story worth filing, I readily enough agreed to refrain
from publishing his secret to the world. Then he extracted
a promise that I should not divulge a word to
any one in the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Ralph Felton is as innocent of that crime as you or
I,’ asserted Thayer when all the conditions for secrecy
had been satisfactorily arranged.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘That is possible, but why did he refuse to answer
the coroner and why did he cut the town?’ said I.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘He had a good reason for wanting to keep dark,
and I suppose he ran away to prevent being compelled
to testify where he was Memorial Day afternoon and
evening.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You know where he was, then?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Yes; he was here at the hotel. I tell you this because
I want you to know that he is innocent. Felton is a good
friend of mine, and I thought perhaps if you knew how
the facts were you might see your way clear to letting
him down as easy as possible in the paper.’ I assured
him that my specialty was setting folks right and then
Thayer told off the following story:</p>

<p class='c011'>“About 2 o’clock on the afternoon of Memorial Day
a woman arrived at Raymond on the afternoon train
from the south, came to this hotel and registered as ‘Isabel
Winthrop.’ She was superbly dressed and displayed
an abundance of jewels. According to Thayer, whose
head was completely turned by her appearance, she was
magnificently, phenomenally beautiful. You can take
that for what it is worth. Thayer assigned her a room
and showed her to it. As she passed in she requested
him to send a messenger to acquaint Ralph Felton that
a lady desired to see him. Finding him was an easy
task, as he was at that moment playing poker in a room
in the hotel. Felton appeared somewhat surprised when
called out, but threw up the game and went to the
woman’s room. That was the last Thayer saw of him
for an hour, when Felton left the hotel. His face was
flushed and he seemed to be laboring under strong excitement.
Before he left he called Thayer to one side. ‘John,’
said he, ‘if you are a friend of mine say nothing about my
caller to-day. You understand?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remarked casually: ‘Then he returned to the hotel
that afternoon?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Oh, yes,’ said he.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘And was there during the evening?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Yes, I noticed him in the office at the time the alarm
over the bank affair was sounded. He left the hotel then
and I did not see him again that night.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Well,’ I asked pointedly, ‘can you swear that Felton
was in the hotel between 7:45 and 8:30 the evening of
Memorial Day?’ I never saw a chap so taken back as
was Thayer. He could not locate Felton at any particular
time during the evening; moreover, he could not say
positively that the Winthrop woman spent the evening
in her room. He supposed she did. The only point that
Thayer was sure of was that the woman left for the south
on the first train the next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thayer,’ said I, consolingly, ‘the only way I see
to clear your absent friend is to find this Winthrop
woman. Describe her to me as accurately as you can.’
He did so and I have a pretty good pen portrait of the
unknown in my memorandum-book, marked ‘Exhibit
A.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Oh, by the way,’ said Thayer, ‘she left a handkerchief
in the room.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The deuce she did! I must have that,’ said I. And
here it is,” said Ashley, passing over a dainty lace creation
for Barker’s inspection. In one corner is the letter
“I” curiously embroidered in silk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are thousands of such handkerchiefs,” comments
the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but not scented with that variety of perfume.”
The detective sniffs it. “Did you ever smell anything
just like that?” queries Ashley. Barker allows that he
never did and his acquaintance with scents is an extended
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Isabel Winthrop is found,” declares Ashley, “that
handkerchief, and especially that perfume, may play an
important part in her discovery.” Barker smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truth is stranger than fiction, my boy,” retorts Ashley.
“Well, what do you think of my clews?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective wraps himself in cigar smoke and
thought for several minutes. Then he extends his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I’ll accept your proposition.” Ashley
returns the pressure warmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think we’ll make a strong pair to draw to,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” adds Barker, “you will see that I am more or
less disinterested when I tell you that I incline to the
belief that neither of your clews, good as they are, is the
correct one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No? Whom do you suspect?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker rises. “Ashley,” says he, “you are young,
enthusiastic and clever. How are you fixed for patience?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Job was a chronic kicker in comparison,” is the
prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, about to-morrow evening I shall be ready
to talk with you and lay out the campaign. Satisfactory?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly. Let’s go down to the billiard room and
knock the balls around for an hour.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>LOUISE HATHAWAY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Good afternoon. Will you walk in?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. I will detain you but a short time.” Jack
Ashley follows Miss Hathaway into the half-lighted
drawing room, accepts the offered chair and seats himself
beside the big bay window. She sinks quietly into
a chair opposite him and glances at the bit of pasteboard
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has seen Louise Hathaway at the inquest and
has remarked that she is an unusually attractive woman.
And now, as his glance for an instant sweeps over her,
he votes her superb.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brief as is his admiring gaze, it is critical. It rests
upon the twined mass of golden hair, drifts over the face
to the long white throat and the strong shoulders, thence
to the faultless figure and sweep of limb. She is as different
from her sister Helen as the placid morning is unlike
the beauteous night. Louise is the morning. There is
a strong sunlight in her glorious blue eyes, but now
they are shadowed by the grief of the last few days.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lifts her eyes from the visiting card. “You are
a reporter,” she says, with a shade of weariness in her
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have the honor of representing the New York Hemisphere.
I do not desire to cause you any annoyance,
but there were some matters not brought out in the
inquest which I wish to investigate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you have come all the way from New York for
this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I have been spending my vacation in Raymond,
and, of course, when the news of the tragedy reached our
paper I was instructed to look after it. I know that the
errand on which I have come must be a painful one for
you to discuss, but I assure you that I have more than
a reportorial interest in the case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes?” She looks at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must be aware that the case is an unusual one,”
he goes on. “My interest in it has grown into a determination
to run down and bring to justice the slayer of
your father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tries to read in the glance she gives him a trace
of gratitude, of approval. Failing, he decides that Louise
Hathaway is an extraordinary young woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you discovered anything—anything that the
local authorities—they are so stupid—have overlooked?”
she asks, and he fancies there is something of anxiety in
the calm, slow tones of a very musical voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” he replies. “We, the detective and myself, are
engaged on several clews. But it is necessary that we
should be in possession of every bit of knowledge obtainable
concerning all the persons who have any bearing,
near or remote, upon the case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway turns upon Ashley a pair of blue eyes
in whose depths he can read naught but purity and
honesty. “I fear I can tell you little,” she says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Derrick Ames—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is innocent,” she interrupts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am of the same opinion. Derrick Ames and your
sister were lovers?” She nods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your father, I am told, strongly opposed the young
man’s attentions. There was a more favored suitor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway regards him with mild surprise. “You
knew then—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What I have come to ask you about more particularly,”
finishes Ashley, unblushingly, regarding his digression
from the truth as a bit of diplomacy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not very well acquainted with him,” avers Miss
Hathaway, “although we have lived in the same town
nearly all our lives. But father regarded him as a model
young man, and until lately encouraged his attentions to
Helen in every way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, who the deuce is she talking about?” wonders
Ashley, who has simply chanced it in his assertion that
there was a more favored suitor than Derrick Ames.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never fancied him, and Helen disliked him exceedingly,”
continues Miss Hathaway. “But the more she
discouraged him the more persistent he became. One
night Helen came to my room in tears. They had had
a fearful scene, she stated. She should marry him or
none, he had declared, and had made all sorts of wild
threats.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not know he was such a desperate character,”
remarks Ashley tentatively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not believe the people of this town knew what
his true character was. Helen said he seemed to have
torn off the mask that night and that his face was that
of a demon. He was wild with rage and left the house
with curses. I sometimes think—” Miss Hathaway
pauses and her face wears a troubled expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What on earth does she think?” meditates Ashley,
who is becoming a trifle bewildered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sometimes think it was his hand that struck down
our poor father. But then he could have had no motive,
and there was in my eyes a reason for his action which
other people could not surmise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet that action seemed unexplainable?” hazards
Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To others, yes. It seemed perhaps a confession of
guilt. But after what Helen told me I firmly believe that
he has gone to search for her. And when he and Derrick
Ames meet, I shudder to think of what may happen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley sees the light at last. So Ralph Felton was the
favored suitor—Ralph Felton, whom nearly every one in
Raymond regarded as a model young man, and who,
despite his unaccountable flight, found plenty of people
willing to explain it in a dozen charitable ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say that until lately Mr. Hathaway regarded
Felton’s attentions to your sister with favor. Had he
any reason for suspending his approval?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I imagine so. During the last month or so he rarely
spoke of him, and once, when his name was mentioned
at table, he frowned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose you know that the case looks black against
Ames; that not half a dozen people in the town have a
good word to say for him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not care what is said against Derrick Ames. I
am sure that he is innocent of any connection with my
father’s death. What he was to others I cannot say, but
in the eyes of Helen and myself he was a noble-hearted
young man, incapable of an unworthy thought or act.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She pleads for him as if for a lover,” thinks Ashley,
regarding with admiration the girl before him. The flash
in the blue eyes and the flush in the cheeks tell of warm
sympathies and a loyal heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your sister never intimated to you the likelihood of
an elopement?” Ashley inquires.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never. Had she a thought of such a thing I should
have known it. We kept nothing from each other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You knew that they met clandestinely?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley shifts the line of questioning to return to it at
a more favorable opportunity. It is apparent that it is
becoming painful to the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were the relations between your father and Mr.
Felton—the elder Felton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost wholly of a business nature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were friends?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. I had noticed, however, that during the last
few weeks they did not meet as often as before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was Mr. Felton at your house within a short time
previous to the murder?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was here the evening before it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything out of the ordinary in the visit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing, except that Mr. Felton appeared to be
angry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you make an effort to recall what happened on
that particular evening?” Louise is thoughtful for a few
moments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear I can recall but little,” she replies slowly. “I
was passing through the hall on my way upstairs, and
as I stepped by the library door I glanced in. Father
was sitting in his desk chair and Mr. Felton was standing
near the door, with his hat in his hand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you hear any of the conversation?” queries Ashley,
with the keenest interest in the new scent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see—yes; I remember Mr. Felton said: ‘I
can’t and I won’t!’ I think those were his words.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did he appear to be excited?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps so. He spoke very loudly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your father’s reply—did you hear that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; I remember I paused an instant from curiosity.
Father said, and I recall that his voice sounded rather
harsh: ‘Then there is but one alternative.’ Then I went
upstairs to my room. A few minutes afterward I heard
the front door slam. Father did not retire until several
hours afterward.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was not his practice to do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; he usually retired early. I don’t see what this
has to do with the mystery—but then I am not a detective
or a newspaper man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may have much to do with it,” murmurs Ashley.
Miss Hathaway looks at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you think?” she asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Candidly, I don’t know what to think,” he confesses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you permit me to turn inquisitor for a few moments?”
Miss Hathaway requests. “There are one or
two questions I should like to have answered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will answer a thousand,” replies Ashley cheerfully,
as he meets the direct gaze of the young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any evidence against Derrick Ames, other
than was brought out at the coroner’s inquest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley notes the anxiety in the voice and hesitates.
It may be cruel, but it also may be profitable, so he
replies slowly to Miss Hathaway:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I regret to say that there are a great many things
about Ames’ movements that will have to be explained
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway covers her face with her hands. A
less keen observer than Ashley could note the hopelessness
in the face that she finally lifts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you said that you believe him innocent,” she
exclaims, almost eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said so, surely,” admits Ashley. “But in order to
prove his innocence it will be necessary to produce him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A silence. Miss Hathaway’s troubled gaze is fixed
upon him. His quick brain has been working and he has
arrived at a conclusion. “This woman believes in the
possibility of Ames’ guilt and she has some reason other
than the evidence that has been produced. Ah, why
didn’t I think of that before?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hathaway,” says Ashley, speaking deliberately,
“you said a moment ago that you would do anything to
assist me in tracing the slayer of your father.” She nods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then will you show me the letter which you received
from your sister upon her arrival in New York?”</p>

<p class='c011'>If Ashley expects any result from this haphazard question
he is assuredly not prepared for what really happens.
Miss Hathaway’s face turns ashen and a great fear
springs into her eyes. She rises to her feet, her hands
clenched.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who told you I received a letter?” she demands in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We newspaper men have many means of obtaining
information,” replies Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Ashley,” the girl says—she is quite calm now—“I
appreciate your efforts fully and thank you for them.
God grant that they may be crowned with success. As
for my sister’s letter, I cannot show it to you, as I have
destroyed it. Its contents I shall never reveal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall hope to see you again before I leave Raymond,”
remarks Ashley, as he rises to take his leave; for
the interview has reached its natural limits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am at home to you at any time,” responds Miss
Hathaway, acknowledging gravely his pleasant adieu.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley saunters back to the hotel his mind is in a
more bewildered condition than at any other time since
he has begun work on the Hathaway case.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that I am in it, I shall stay, if it occupies the
rest of my natural life,” he determines. “What a magnificent
young woman! Fortunate that I am not susceptible,
else I should already be idiotically in love with
this queen of the morning, whose sad blue eyes haunt
me still, in the words of the old song.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, the self-sufficiency of youth!</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>MR. BARKER’S DISCOVERIES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>After supper Ashley retreats to the most secluded
corner of the veranda and amuses himself blowing smoke
rings over the railing. Barker has been gone ever since
morning. He must have struck a warm trail. Twilight
gathers ere Ashley beholds the familiar figure swinging
down the street toward the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective draws a chair beside that of Ashley, and,
after making certain that no listeners are about, remarks
complacently: “My boy, I believe we are on the trail
of Roger Hathaway’s murderer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed! I confess that I am deeper in the woods
of speculation than ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but when I give you the result of my day’s work
I think you will find yourself out of the forest and on
the broad highway of conviction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you must have put in a more profitable afternoon
than I spent, and I accomplished considerable. Had
your supper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. Guess I’ll run in and have supper and then we’ll
adjourn to my room for a smoke talk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later finds the New Yorkers comfortably
settled in Barker’s second-floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may as well state at the outset that, as you intimated
when you introduced yourself last evening, I am
not a Sherlock Holmes,” begins Barker. “But I have
had considerable experience in ferreting out criminals.
A good memory for faces, an extensive acquaintance with
the brilliants and lesser lights of the crook world, a
knack of putting two and two together with a view to
obtaining four as a result, more or less analytical abilities,
an excellent physique, a fair amount of sand and an
unlimited stock of patience are my qualifications for
the profession upon which I have thus far brought no
discredit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pretty good stock in trade, I should say,” comments
Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. Now, every detective waits patiently for
what he regards as his big case. I think this Hathaway
affair is mine—or ours, as we are working together.
Now, I’ll get down to business and tell you what I have
discovered to-day. We may as well begin with a comprehensive
study of the cast of characters. Unfortunately,
three of the leading ones are beyond our reach.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you figure Derrick Ames extensively in the
case?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather. We will begin with him and consider his
probable relation to what is destined to be a celebrated
case.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is unfortunate that the people in the world whose
photographs one is likely to want at some time or
another are the very people who seldom run to pictures,”
resumes Barker. “There isn’t a picture of Ames in existence.
So far as known he never had one taken. Nor
are there any photos of Helen Hathaway to be had. The
only portraits of her in existence are the miniature in the
locket missing from the dead cashier’s watch-chain and
a crayon portrait which, I am informed, hangs in a room
at her late home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I find that Ames was regarded as an odd stick by the
discriminating inhabitants of Raymond—principally because
he did not associate with them more than was
absolutely necessary. He is said to be well educated
and is of a high-strung, poetic temperament. Heaven
knows how he came to locate in such a prosy town as
Raymond, but the explanation of his remaining here as
long as he did is simpler; he was apparently devoted to
Helen Hathaway. I say apparently for want of knowledge
of what his exact sentiments were. Of his early
history I learned little, save that he came here some three
years ago from New York State, studied law with a local
counsellor, and finally took an excellent position with the
Vermont Life Insurance Company.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oddly enough, the one male companion that Ames
chose was a chap about as opposite in temperament and
every other way as one can imagine. Sam Brockway is
the name of the fellow, and he is employed as a cutter
in the sheds of the Wild River Granite Company. And
Ames hunted him up only when he got into one of his
periodical fits of the blues, and the two would start off
on a racket that would last several days. It was this
habit of drinking, combined with a cynical skepticism
upon matters and things dear to the heart of a deacon,
that made Ames objectionable to Mr. Hathaway, and
the antipathy was cordially returned. Helen, however,
was a loyal little woman, and despite her father’s commands
she continued her intimacy with Ames. An elopement
was a logical sequence of such a companionship,
and were it not for certain damning evidence that I
extracted from this Brockway and discovered myself, I
should dismiss Ames, temporarily at least, as having
no connection with the bank case.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you say Brockway is a friend of Ames’,” remarks
Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is. But while a good-hearted chap and loyalty
itself, he is not especially astute and by shrewd questioning
and judicious bluffing I discovered that he was
probably the last man who saw Ames before he disappeared
from Raymond, Roger Hathaway excepted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean that Derrick Ames was seen to enter the Raymond
National Bank about 8 o’clock on the evening
of Memorial Day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“H’m! That is serious. Yet his mission may have
been an innocent one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True. But to continue. This forenoon I visited the
station at Ashfield, where Ames and the girl—there can
be no question that they were the pair—boarded the night
express south. While I was lounging about the station,
waiting for the train back to Raymond, my eye caught
the glitter of an object lying between the inside rail of
the track and the south end of the platform, and partly
under the latter. It was a revolver, 32 caliber, and one
chamber was empty. With that for a basis, I questioned
the station agent on another tack, and he finally succeeded
in remembering that just as the train pulled into
the station that memorable night the girl handed Ames
his coat, and as he threw it over his arm an object dropped
from one of the pockets, which Ames quickly recovered
and replaced in the coat as he and his companion clambered
aboard the train. Might not this revolver have
been the object dropped by Ames, and might he not when
he put it back in his coat have slipped it into the sleeve,
through which it dropped as he stepped upon the train?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the theory is ingenious, even if wrong,” muses
Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I clinched it a bit more,” continues Barker. “Where
had Ames and the girl boarded the train? The station
agent remembered that it was at the south end of the
platform, as the New York sleeper was made up next
behind the engine and baggage car.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg to remark,” puts in Ashley, “that the fact of
one chamber in a revolver being empty is not at all
unusual. I have in my pocket a gun in that condition,
but as it is a 38 caliber, that lets me out of any connection
with the tragedy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” smiles Barker, “I take all these bits of
evidence for what they are worth. While waiting for my
train I argued in this wise: Derrick Ames was in love
with Helen Hathaway, and the attachment resulted in
an elopement. Neither was seen after 2 o’clock of
Memorial Day, and the inference is that they were together
somewhere all the afternoon and evening. The
elopement was apparently unpremeditated, as they took
nothing with them, so far as known, except the clothes
they wore. There must have been some cause for such
an impromptu exit. People do not elope that way no
matter how love-mad they may be. Where was Helen
when Ames was seen going into the bank? Waiting
for him somewhere. What was his errand? To make
a final appeal for the girl’s hand, with an elopement in
mind as the last resort, perhaps. But even failing in
that, why elope that particular night? There must have
been a cause for hurrying him away. But if you assume
that Ames committed the crime, even as the upshot of a
fierce quarrel, even perhaps in self-defense, you must
figure him a moral monstrosity, for only such could strike
down a father and elope subsequently with the daughter.
And then there is the missing money. You see it argues
a villainy more despicable than a man like Ames could
have been guilty of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet pathology records even more singular instances
of moral distortion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even so. But is it not more reasonable to believe that
Ames may have been only a witness to the murder, or
a spectator on the scene of the tragedy after it had occurred,
and that he was hurried away by the horror of
the affair? But in either event would he not have argued
that to fly would be the worst possible thing he could do?
I confess that when I arrived at Raymond I was in doubt
as to Ames’ possible guilt, but my afternoon’s investigations
have about convinced me that Derrick Ames had
nothing to do with the death of Cashier Hathaway.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you must have substituted some other person
as the object of your suspicion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but the substitution is not especially recent. Before
I give you the result of my afternoon labors let me
tell you of a discovery that I made yesterday, not three
hours after my arrival in town.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After I had posted myself from the stenographic
notes of the inquest I dropped into the bank to have a
talk with the officials. President Felton took me into the
directors’ room, where the tragedy occurred, and I sat
in the cashier’s chair and glanced around to get a few
bearings. While Felton was retelling his story of the
finding of Hathaway’s body I toyed with a blotter on the
desk. It was the ordinary blotter, larger than the average,
with the advertisement of an insurance company on
one side. As I glanced carelessly at it I noticed that
it had taken up the ink of some unusually plain characters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Felton was called out of the room for a moment and
I slipped the blotter in my pocket to examine it at my
leisure. When I returned to the hotel I made an investigation,
and I discovered—but I will let you see for
yourself. Hand me that small mirror on the wall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley does so. The detective takes his prize from
a bundle of papers in his pocket, smooths it flat on the
table, and places the mirror perpendicularly before it.
Then he draws the lamp over and remarks complacently:
“Look here upon this picture!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And this is what Ashley sees as he gazes upon the
reflecting surface. There are three groups of characters.
The first group reads:</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A SIFTING OF EVIDENCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Both men smoke on in a brief silence that Ashley
breaks with an inquiring “Well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Much,” is Barker’s smiling response. “Now, my
boy,” he adds briskly, as he extracts a bunch of writing
paper from his grip and sharpens his pencil, “tell me
everything you know concerning the dramatis personae
in this drama. We will get our facts together, and then
I’ll give you my theories—for I have more than one. Go
ahead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Ashley has exhausted his stock of information
and has hazarded one or two ingenious theories, the detective
leans back in his chair and for the space of five
minutes says not a word. Finally he turns to Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This Hathaway mystery,” he begins, “is either simplicity
itself or it is shrouded in a veil that only the
patient search and unceasing effort of months will lift.
My first glance at the case led me to believe that the
murder was the work of a professional, so swiftly had it
been accomplished and so completely had the work of
the operator been covered up. But the most earnest
search has failed to discover the presence in town on
Memorial Day of any person who could possibly be
regarded as a suspicious character, except Ernest Stanley,
of whom more anon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the deed must have been committed by some
one in Raymond. Thus far we have evidence affecting
four men—Derrick Ames, Cyrus Felton, Ralph Felton,
and Ernest Stanley. If two of the four were implicated
it could have been only the Feltons, father and son. I do
not say that any of the four is the guilty man. But a
chain of evidence must be forged about the slayer of
Roger Hathaway, and in order that this chain shall be
complete, minus not a single link, it becomes necessary
for us to establish the innocence of these four men, if
they are innocent, as well as the presumptive guilt of a
fifth party, if a fifth party committed the crime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In other words, we are hampered by a superabundance
of clews.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. I will pardon your interruption, but no
more of them, unless they are good ones. Now, your
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Roger Hathaway was killed in his office in the bank
on the evening of Memorial Day, some time between
7:45 and 8:30 o’clock. No definite minute or five minutes
can be fixed. Two of our characters were, we know,
and the other two may have been, at the bank between
7:45 and 8:30. To begin with Ames. Sam Brockway
tells me that he saw Ames enter the bank after Hathaway
had handed a note to the boy, Jimmie Howe. Brockway
did not stay to see Ames come out; when the latter
did emerge he was unseen. It is not unreasonable to
assume that Ames killed Hathaway as the climax of a
bitter quarrel over the latter’s daughter, and that, to
facilitate his escape, he helped himself to the bank’s funds.
But it is unreasonable to assume that subsequently he
induced the daughter to elope with him. That is the
weak link in that chain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But suppose that the elopement was already under
way; that everything had been arranged for, hour of departure,
route and conveyance,” debates Ashley. “Would
not Ames argue that solitary flight, and a failure to
carry out the prearranged plans must weigh heavily
against him? An elopement is an excellent excuse for
leaving town hurriedly, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possible,” returns the detective. “Now, the letter
which you say Louise Hathaway received from her sister,
but the contents of which she refuses to reveal, must
have contained some reference to Ames which Miss
Hathaway has reasons for concealing. At any rate, there
is good ground for suspecting that Ames knows something
of the murder of Roger Hathaway, whether or no
his own hand was stained with the cashier’s blood. Now,”
says Barker, turning to the blotter and the mirror on
the table, and propping up the reflector with the water
pitcher, “look that over carefully, Ashley, and tell me what
you find.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley draws his chair up to the table and examines
critically the characters on the blotter as reflected in
the mirror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All of the words which are distinguishable were not,
when blotted, on the same sheet of paper,” he asserts.
“At least two and perhaps three sheets of paper were
used. The words, ‘your personal account overdrawn,’
must have been at the bottom of one sheet and those
with the signature attached upon another, but whether
top, middle, or bottom of the page is of no consequence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” approves Barker. “That was the first
conclusion I arrived at when I examined the blotter.
Now, how about those words, ‘Come to the bank immediately’?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their position is not so clear to me. Their nature
would indicate that they began the letter, but if so I
cannot see why they should blot and the words following
them should not appear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if they were part of another letter—what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah,” remarks Ashley, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am assuming, and I think reasonably, that the blotter
was first used upon the letter or letters whose contents
we are attempting to guess,” says Barker. “There
are many faint marks around the legible words, but naturally
only the words concluding each page would be
distinguishable. Those above would be either dry or
in process of drying. But what else do you deduce, Ashley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, the writing does not display, in my opinion,
undue haste or agitation. I am not an expert in handwriting,
but I should say that this letter was written at
a normal speed and by a man in a comparatively calm
condition of mind. The signature is bold and firm, as
are all the legible characters. I should also say that this
letter was the one which Roger Hathaway sent to Cyrus
Felton half an hour or so before he was found dead
in his office.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You remember Felton’s testimony at the inquest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly. He stated that the note he received contained
the simple request: ‘Come to the bank immediately.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you think he lied to the coroner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would seem so. Unless—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless the note he received at his house on the evening
of Memorial Day did contain only that brief summons,
which is contained in the five words at the top
of the blotter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely,” agrees Ashley. “That brings us to the
question, when was the other letter written? It must
have been previous to the note referred to at the inquest,
but how many hours or days before? Let me have your
theory, Barker. My mind is already shaping a shadowy
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective chews his cigar reflectively. “Suppose
that Roger Hathaway discovered, some time ago—within
a few weeks, we will say—that the affairs of the bank
were not in the condition that they should be?” he hazards.
“An examination of the books showed not only
that the president’s personal account was overdrawn, but
that certain operations of the latter had jeopardized the
soundness of the institution. The knowledge might have
been expected or unexpected. In either case the cashier
realized that something had to be done, and at once.
So on the day before Memorial Day, or even earlier,
he wrote a letter to the president and couched it in plain
English. He instanced the overdrawal of the president’s
personal account and a number of other unpleasant conditions,
and urged upon that gentleman the necessity for
an immediate adjustment of the critical affairs, closing
with the admonition, ‘Fail not, Cyrus Felton, at the peril
of your good name.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Having dispatched his letter to the president, the
cashier waited anxiously for a reply. It came in the
form of a call by Felton at the residence of Hathaway
the evening before Memorial Day. The interview was a
stormy one. At least we know it was not harmonious.
The cashier again set forth the necessity for immediate
action. Ways and means were discussed, but no way out
of the tangle seemed clear. In desperation the cashier
suggested some unpleasant but safe method of salvation.
The president responded angrily, ‘I can’t and I won’t!’
and the cashier answered decisively, ‘Then there is only
one alternative.’ Without waiting to discuss this alternative,
the president left the house in a temper and the
cashier sat up in his library for hours afterward, meditating
on the crisis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, what was this ‘one alternative’ indicated by the
cashier? Clearly publicity of the bank’s condition and
its subsequent wreck. The next day was Memorial Day.
The cashier took part in the solemn services and in the
evening he went to the bank to perform some necessary
work upon the books, the teller being ill. No word had
come from the president, no intimation that he was
prepared to follow out the course pointed out the night
before, and avoid the disgrace which the wreck of the
bank would entail. Again the desperation of the situation
flashed upon the cashier. The president must act, and at
once. So the cashier indited a brief but peremptory note
to the president: ‘Come to the bank immediately.’ This
he delivered to Jimmy Howe, whom he found on the
bridge tossing pebbles into the stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The president answered the summons. Within the
cashier’s office the accusation, apparently so plainly indicated
on this blotter, was repeated verbally. A sharp dispute
followed. Hot words led to blows. The drawer
of the cashier’s desk was open and his revolver lay in
view. Can you supply the rest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the open vault and the missing money and securities?”
contends Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The vault may have been, probably was, already open.
The missing funds—had been missing for some little
time,” replies Barker, with a significant smile. Then he
resumes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Felton testified that on the night of the tragedy he
reached the bank about 8:20. As he left his house about
8:05 he must have got to the bank not far from 8:15. It
is not more than ten minutes’ walk, even at an ordinary
pace. He told Sheriff Wilson, when he found the latter
at the hotel, that he discovered Hathaway ‘only a few
moments ago.’ Yet the sheriff stated to me that he was
positive it was 8:35 when he was informed of the affair.
He looked at his watch when he was accompanying Felton
to the bank. Again, Felton told the coroner that ‘it
did not seem more than a minute that I spent in the
bank,’ so that here we have a hiatus of fully a quarter of
an hour. Now, where was Felton during that fifteen
minutes if not in the company of Roger Hathaway? If
Hathaway was dead when Felton reached the bank, why
was not the sheriff informed earlier? You see there is
an apparent discrepancy that might be explained on the
theory that Hathaway was alive when Felton entered the
bank, and that an interview of ten or fifteen minutes was
ended by the death of the cashier.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF CLEWS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Having allowed Ashley to digest the food for thought
furnished by the detective, the latter resumes his story:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my return from Ashfield I called upon Cyrus
Felton, found him at his residence and interviewed him
in his library for fully an hour. When I introduced myself
as a detective he started visibly. In place of the
extreme agitation which characterized his testimony at
the inquest, he betrayed a nervousness rather peculiar,
to say the least, in one whose knowledge of the crime
embraced only what he related to the coroner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I questioned him minutely, avoiding any direct query
that would be likely to arouse his suspicions. To my
question, ‘When did you last see Mr. Hathaway?’ he
replied that it was on the afternoon of Memorial Day,
when the Grand Army post marched to the cemetery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘And before that—when?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hesitated a few moments and answered that he
had last talked with the cashier several days, probably a
week, before the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Your relations with Mr. Hathaway were always of
a friendly nature?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Eminently so.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“The answer was straightforward and the look that
accompanied it was open and direct, the only one, by the
way, during the entire interview. Of course I was not
at the time aware of the unharmonious interview which,
as Miss Hathaway reported to you, occurred at her father’s
house on the evening preceding Memorial Day. Lie
No. 1, conceding that he told the truth about the note
which he received from the cashier on the evening of
the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now, this revolver of Mr. Hathaway’s, what sort
of a weapon was it, Mr. Felton?’ I asked. He gave me
a half-startled look and I fancied that his gaze strayed
for an instant to the safe set in the wall of his library. It
flashed upon me that the lost gun was concealed behind
the steel door of that same safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The revolver,’ he said, in an absent sort of way; ‘oh,
it was an ordinary affair, 32 caliber, I believe they called
it, nickeled and with a pearl handle. I had often seen it
lying in Mr. Hathaway’s drawer, but so far as I know
it was never used.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Would you recognize that revolver if you should see
it again, Mr. Felton?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I don’t know as I could positively identify it. Revolvers
are so much alike, are they not?’ I nodded, and
again his eyes shifted toward the door of his safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as I say, I talked with him for about an hour,
most of the interview dealing with the forgery case of
two years ago, in which our mysterious friend, Ernest
Stanley, figured as the principal. But of that more later.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was about 5 o’clock when I called at Felton’s house,
and the supper bells of the neighborhood were ringing
when I left. Instead of going to the hotel I struck down
a side street to the river road, for a smoke and a stroll,
and a chance to run the Hathaway case over in my mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Half a mile below the village there is quite a stretch
of road without any houses along it. The cemetery is
on one side, the river on the other. I was sprawling on
the stone wall that skirts the city of the dead and looking
toward the village, when I saw a figure rapidly approaching.
‘Cyrus Felton or I’m a goat!’ I exclaimed, and
rolled out of sight behind the wall. My eyesight is keen
and I could not mistake the tall, lank form of the bank
president. ‘What the deuce is he doing down this road
at an hour when he should be peacefully eating his supper?’
I wondered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Felton passed around the bend in the road
I sprung over the wall and followed at a cautious distance.
He looked around once or twice, and I had to
dodge behind a tree each time. Suddenly he stopped and
walked out upon the bank of the river, while I again
took up a position behind my friendly stone wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our banker walked to the edge of the river, and,
with his hands clasped behind him, stared at the water,
now and then casting a look up and down the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Heavens! Is he going to commit suicide?’ I thought.
Surely my mild catechism had not driven him to such an
extremity. My fears were shortly allayed. He suddenly
thrust his hand into his coat pocket, and, withdrawing
some object, hurled it into the stream. It sunk with a
small splash. I was too far away to more than guess
what the object was. Felton remained on the bank for
several minutes, gazing at the surface of the river, then
suddenly wheeled and started toward the village. As
he passed me I fancied he looked a bit more relieved
in mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After he was out of sight I walked over to the river
and marked as near as possible the spot where he had
stood. The river at that point is deep, and I fear that
the bottom is muddy, as the stream makes a sharp bend
and spreads into a broad lagoon, with little or no current.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You intend to go a-fishing?” queries Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At daylight, if we can get a boat of some sort.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if our search is rewarded by the finding of a
revolver—the revolver—what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I think we shall have a case against Cyrus Felton
stronger than we shall make out against any one
else. I can see by your face that you are only half convinced
of that fact,” continues Barker. “You are more
inclined to suspect the younger Felton than the elder,
eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” argues the newspaper man, “in the case of
Ralph Felton there is a motive, an evil temper, and
what is usually regarded as confession of guilt—flight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. Let us look over young Felton’s case,” says
the detective. “Ralph Felton, we know, is possessed of
an evil temper and a disposition to bullyrag a young lady
who is sensible enough not to love him. We know also
that he gambles with traveling men who put up here,
and drinks more or less. As the good people of this
town regard Ralph as a model young man, his indulgence
in cards and wine on the quiet shows a broad
streak of deception in his character.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His inclinations toward gayety were not cultivated
in his native town. Previous to a twelvemonth ago four
or five years of his life were spent in New York, Chicago
and other cities. His occupation during a share of that
time was that of representative and selling agent for the
granite company in which his father is the principal
stock owner. He was apparently wild and reckless, for
a year ago he returned to Raymond and through the
efforts of his father was given the position of bookkeeper
in the bank, a position which does not usually pay
much. It would appear that the elder Felton had
enacted the role of the prodigal’s father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While Ralph Felton was ‘down country’ he fell in
love with a pretty face, and upon its possessor he squandered
all his means and more. When Ralph returned to
Raymond the woman wrote to him demanding money
and a fulfillment of pledges. The former he had not;
of the latter he had no thought, as he had become desperately
enamored of Helen Hathaway. Unable to obtain
satisfaction by a correspondence, the woman visited
Raymond the afternoon of Memorial Day, registered as
‘Isabel Winthrop,’ and sent word to Ralph that a lady
desired to see him. He went to her. The interview between
the pair was not harmonious. Sounds of a quarrel
came from the room, and once or twice the word ‘money’
was used. Half an hour or so from the time he entered
the hotel Ralph left with a flushed countenance, first
pledging the clerk to say nothing of his feminine caller.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has essayed promises with her, but something
substantial is demanded to back them up. He must have
money, but where is it to be secured? No use to apply
to his father, that he well knows. The more he racks
his brain the more desperate becomes the situation. Then
a wild thought comes to him. The bank! There must
be a large amount of money in the safe. The county
bonds mature the next day. He knows, we will assume—perhaps
the knowledge is accidental—the combination
of the safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ralph returns to the hotel, and, with a calmness born
of a desperate resolve, informs ‘Isabel Winthrop’ that he
has arranged for the needed funds, and reiterates his
promises for the future. As dusk comes on he leaves the
hotel unobserved by the clerk, goes to the bank, opens
the front door and locks it behind him, and proceeds
to the cashier’s office in the rear, wherein open the doors
to the vault.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As with a trembling hand he twists the combination
of the vault he hears the sound of a key in the outer
door. He springs to his feet and casts a startled glance
about him. There is no egress from the room save by
the way he came. Ah! The closet! He secretes himself
in the dark closet at the farther end of the room, and
at that instant Roger Hathaway enters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘The cashier,’ murmurs the prisoner in the closet, as
through the partially open door he watches Hathaway
light his desk lamp. ‘He has dropped in to get some
papers and will soon be gone,’ thinks Ralph. But to the
latter’s despair the cashier opens the vault, takes out the
big ledger, and settles down apparently to an evening’s
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is a nice predicament, but there is nothing to
be done except wait until the cashier finishes his evening’s
work and goes home. Half an hour or more goes
by. The closet is dusty and Ralph is seized with an irresistible
desire to sneeze. The explosion, a half-smothered
one, occurs, and the cashier looks about him in surprise
and wonder. But he continues his work. Suddenly Felton
sees him seize a pad of writing paper, scratch off a
brief note and leave the room to find a messenger. Has
the cashier suspected the presence of some person in
the bank besides himself and has he taken this means to
summon assistance? As this thought flashes upon him
young Felton becomes desperate, but as he watches the
face of the cashier, who returns calmly to his writing, he
convinces himself that he is mistaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again that cursed inclination to sneeze, which in vain
he attempts to smother. This time there is no mistake.
The cashier rises to his feet and glances about the room
in alarm. His eyes finally rest on the partly opened
door of the dark closet. Hathaway is a man of nerve.
He opens the right-hand drawer of his desk, takes out
and cocks his revolver and walks deliberately toward the
closet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this is seen by Ralph, and his plan to rob the bank
is succeeded by a desire to escape from the building
unrecognized. To accomplish this the cashier must be
overpowered. So when the latter flings open the closet
door the man within reaches out, grasps the revolver
arm and draws the cashier into the darkness of the
closet. Then ensues a fierce struggle, for Roger Hathaway,
though old, is still a powerful man. This would
account for the old ledgers that were toppled over into
the office, and for the marks on the body of the murdered
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“During the struggle the revolver is discharged and
the bullet enters the cashier’s heart. The doctors in the
case tell me that the course of the bullet was such that
the leaden missile might have come from a pistol discharged
during such a struggle as I have described. But
to continue:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ralph Felton draws the limp form of the cashier out
into the office and lays it upon the floor. A moment’s
examination shows him that the man is dead, and he
realizes his frightful position. Then the thought occurs
to him that, if he carries out his original plan of robbing
the bank, the crime will be ascribed to burglars. So he
fills his pockets with what money and securities are in
the safe, closes the door to the cashier’s office behind him
and leaves the bank, with the front door unlocked or
ajar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless—” interrupts Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless,” says the newspaper man, leaning back in his
chair and blowing a cloud of smoke ceilingward—“unless
Ralph Felton, when he rose from his examination of the
body, was suddenly confronted by his father, who had
come to the bank in response to the summons sent by
the cashier!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE KEY TO THE MYSTERY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Following along the lines of your theory,” continues
Ashley, “if Ralph Felton rose from the corpse of Roger
Hathaway and confronted his father upon the threshold
of the cashier’s office, that dramatic meeting would explain
many things. It would explain the startled glance
that Cyrus Felton shot at his son—I was studying the
faces of both—when the latter refused to state at the
inquest where he had spent the time between 7:45 and
8:30 on the evening of Memorial Day. It would account
for the carrying off of the cashier’s revolver and its
subsequent burial among the waters of Wild River; for
young Felton’s flight, and for the extreme agitation of
the elder Felton ever since the night of the killing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And,” adds Barker, “it would satisfactorily clear up
the interim of fifteen minutes between the time Cyrus
Felton should have reached the bank and the moment
when the sheriff was notified. In fact, if the Felton family
is responsible for the death of Roger Hathaway there
must be some understanding between father and son.
But we will now proceed to the consideration of an
important character in our tragedy—Ernest Stanley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two years ago, while the directors of the Raymond
National Bank were holding their annual meeting, the
teller stepped into the room and announced that a
stranger had presented at the bank for payment a check
for $1,000, signed by Cyrus Felton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Impossible!’ exclaimed that individual, who was presiding
over the directors’ meeting. ‘Let me see the
check.’ The teller produced it, and Felton at once declared
it a forgery, and a bungling one at that. An officer
was quickly summoned and Ernest Stanley, who had
presented the check, was arrested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His trial in the Mansfield County Court was short.
The forgery was proved and the young man was sentenced
to three years in the state prison at Windsor. In
his own defense—he had no money with which to employ
a lawyer—Stanley stated that the check had been given
to him two days before he presented it, by a casual acquaintance
who claimed the name signed to the bit of
paper. It was in payment of a gambling debt and the
transaction occurred in Phil Clark’s well-known lair of
the tiger on Fifth Avenue, New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which, by the way, is no more,” puts in Ashley. “The
place was closed out six months ago and Phil is now
in ’Frisco.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was in existence during Stanley’s trial,” resumes
Barker, “and the trial was adjourned a couple of days
while his improbable story was looked up. As was
expected, neither Phil nor any of the habitues of his
place knew of such a person as Ernest Stanley, much
less such a transaction as he alleged to have occurred
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stanley received his sentence calmly. Beyond stating
that his age was 26 and his occupation that of a bookmaker
he refused to furnish any details of his birth, early
life or present residence. He served two years of his
sentence and was pardoned by the governor this last
Memorial Day. Strangely enough, the pardon was secured
by the man whose name he was alleged to have
forged—Cyrus Felton. Now, what feelings do you suppose
actuated Felton in securing a remission of a year
in the prisoner’s sentence? Compassion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What should you say were I to suggest the word
‘remorse’?” replies Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should say,” declares the detective, with a smile of
approval, “that you had hit upon the very word. It is
plain that you foresee what I am leading up to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the theory that Stanley was innocent of the forgery
and that the check was given to him by Ralph Felton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. It will be difficult to prove, but if it can be
proved it will have an important bearing on the Hathaway
mystery. It will show Ralph Felton’s capacity for
wrongdoing and will enable us to surmise to what extent
Cyrus Felton would shield his son from conviction of a
crime. At the time the check was presented Ralph Felton
was supposed to be in New York, and as he had been
for some time more or less of a trial to the old man the
latter doubtless suspected in an instant what we are
assuming to have been the truth. He had to decide between
his son and a stranger, and, as usual, the stranger
suffered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What led Stanley to attempt to cash the check in
Raymond?” debates Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if he was a stranger in New York he would
find it impossible to cash it at any of the banks in that
city. Why not run up to Raymond and cash it at the
bank on which it was drawn? I forgot to say that at
the trial Stanley alleged that his acquaintance of the gambling
rooms claimed to be a Vermonter and appeared to
have plenty of money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he did not hazard the suggestion that this acquaintance
was the son of the man whose name was
forged?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did not know that there was a son. To prove
this, if the visitor at Cyrus Felton’s house on the evening
of Memorial Day was the released prisoner of Windsor,
note his surprised reply to the housemaid, ‘I did not
know there were two Feltons.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” admits Ashley. “Keep along, old man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Stanley was that visitor,” pursues the detective, “his
object in revisiting Raymond was to obtain revenge for
the wrong that had been done him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When he arrived at Raymond, at 7:45, he went directly
to Felton’s house. Failing to find the bank president
at home, he obtained directions as to where Felton’s
office was and proceeded to the bank block. The office,
which is on the second story, at the south end of the
block, was dark and Stanley returned to the street. As
he stood in front of the bank and thought of the day,
two long years before, when he stepped from its portals
with a constable gripping his arm, he noticed a light in
the rear. Perhaps Felton was within. So he pushed
open the door and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on a bit. How does the bank door come to
be open? You are assuming a great deal this time,
Barker,” laughs Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am assuming that he got into the bank some way
or other,” retorts the detective. “If not—and here I
will quote your own words when you imparted to me
your valuable discovery—‘What was Stanley doing at 6
o’clock the next morning asleep in the bushes in a lonely
gorge near South Ashfield village?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley laughs merrily. “I was expecting that,” he
says. “But I’ll be hanged if I will believe that an Edmond
Dantes sort of a chap like Ernest Stanley is capable
of—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Permit me to suggest that Ernest Stanley may be
a cheap criminal instead of an Edmond Dantes,” interrupts
Barker, with a withering sarcasm that only increases
Ashley’s good humor. “We have given him a
good character simply to suit our present theory. He
may have really forged old Felton’s name, and his visit
to Raymond may have been actuated by a base desire
for revenge upon a stern justice meted out to him. Alone
in the bank with Roger Hathaway and the open vault,
murder and robbery may have come natural to him. We
know nothing that should lead us to decide that he was
a much-abused young man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you believe he is, I’ll wager,” asserts Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I confess that I do. A man would be half a dozen
kinds of a fool to forge the name of the president of a
bank and present the check for payment at the latter’s
own bank. Still what evidence we have against Stanley
is strong. We can account for the flight of Derrick
Ames on the simple elopement theory. We can explain
the levanting of Ralph Felton on the theory that he
refused to establish an alibi because it would necessitate
the confession of an acquaintance with ‘Isabel Winthrop,’
when he was an ardent suitor for the hand of Helen Hathaway,
and on the further supposition that he has gone
to hunt for the woman he insanely loved. We can explain
the nervous condition of Cyrus Felton on the assumption
that he fears his son was implicated in the
bank robbery and trembles for his safety. But we cannot
explain why Ernest Stanley fled from Raymond the
night of Memorial Day and hurried over mountain and
stream and through forest, chased like a wild beast,
until he found a haven of refuge. The open bank door
is the break in the chain of evidence against him,
and that may be mended by assuming that the cashier
forgot to lock the door behind him when he entered
the bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must find Stanley,” Ashley promptly declares.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And there are others to be found,” the detective
rejoins dryly. “But especially must we run down Stanley.
I am convinced that he is the key to the mystery,
and when we have located his position in this puzzling
case I believe that the rest of the race will be plain
sailing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear it will be a long, stern chase.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such chases usually are,” remarks Barker, composedly.
“I have already set the machinery in motion,
and the police of the entire country are on the lookout
for a chap answering Stanley’s description. What makes
our task the harder is the probable fact that Stanley is
not a member of the criminal class, and so a comparatively
easy channel of pursuit is closed. He presumably
made for New York, and somewhere in that busy
human hive we may run across him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then our labors at this end of the road are about
completed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nearly so. To-morrow morning, before the village
is astir, we will go a-fishing. If we find what we expect
the case may be precipitated a bit. Otherwise we will
shift the scene of our operations to New York, after I
have pumped the servants in the Felton family and
inquired as far as is possible into the affairs of the bank.
Is your vacation about wound up?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be in a day or so. I have nothing to keep
me here longer except a pleasant duty that I owe to
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that is—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To make an unprofessional call upon Miss Louise
Hathaway.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho! Sits the wind in that quarter?” laughs the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be absurd, my friend,” smiles Ashley. “Miss
Hathaway interests me only as would a statue of the
Venus de Milo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? Still, men have lost their hearts to a statue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In books and plays. If we are to arise at daybreak
I would suggest the advisability of retiring.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A CHANGE OF BASE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“I believe this is the exact spot; yes, I am sure it is.
Drop your anchor, Ashley, so that the bow will point
up-stream,” says Barker, as he grasps a long pole with
a hook at one end, and prepares to explore the bed
of Wild River.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley lets go the rock that does duty as an anchor and
remarks ruefully, when all but a yard of the rope is run
out: “This is deep-sea fishing. There is over twelve
feet of water here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunder! And mud enough to bury a man-of-war,”
grunts the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>After fifteen minutes of earnest but ineffectual groping
in the slimy bed of the stream Barker throws the
pole from him and remarks: “No use.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t the river be dredged?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; with a force of men and a steam dredger, and
the whole township looking on and asking questions.
We can do nothing this morning. Up anchor and away!
I could use a little breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way,” observes Ashley, as the two men walk
back to the hotel, “in all your talk last night you said
nothing of that locket, with the miniatures of the Hathaway
sisters, which was stolen from the watch-chain of
the murdered cashier the night of the killing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know it was stolen on that night?” asks the
detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must assume that it was until we know otherwise,
I suppose,” returns Ashley. “If the missing locket
is found in the possession of any one of our suspects
it would be a strong link, would it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely, but we must find our man first. Shall
you be ready to leave for New York to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. We must strike the trail there and follow it,
if need be, to the end of the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has been in Raymond only two weeks, but already
he begins to sigh for the pleasures and palaces
of gay, crowded and babel-voiced New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it!” he growls to Barker, as he packs his valise,
“this Vermont country is all right, but the natives are
atrocious. They know no literature except those provincial
Boston dailies and the current paper-covered rot;
no music except Sousa’s marches, no art except the colored
supplements to the Sunday newspapers and no conversation
higher than horse, hay and village gossip.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your criticism is too sweeping,” replies the detective.
“There is more culture in Raymond, in proportion to its
population, than there is in New York, I’ll wager. And
where in that politics-ridden city will you find another
woman rivaling your fervid description of Miss Louise
Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, she is a rose in a wilderness. And that reminds
me that I have promised myself the pleasure of a farewell
call upon her,” says Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell?” repeats the detective, skeptically. “You
will not see the last of Miss Hathaway to-day unless I
am much mistaken. I have known of more than one
lover of statuary who failed to be content with the marble
and warmed it into living, breathing womanhood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” laughs Ashley. “I shall live and die a
bachelor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he spends fully ten minutes in tying his cravat,
brushes his hair with unusual care, gives his mustache
an extra twist, and saunters up to the Hathaway
homestead in an expectant frame of mind. Foolish Jack
Ashley! In after years he will smile at the recollection
of the thoughts that flit through his busy mind to-day.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just as he turns into the path leading to the Hathaway
residence Miss Hathaway is stepping out upon the
veranda. She sees him and smiles in her grave way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good afternoon,” she says to her visitor. He answers,
uncovering his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I called to say au revoir. I leave for New York to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She leads the way to the reception room. After they
have taken their seats near the open window she answers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will return? Your work here on—on the case
is not yet finished?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; we shall have occasion to visit Raymond more
than once before the mystery which shrouds the bank
case is dispelled. It is going to be a long chase, I fear,
Miss Hathaway. But I hope to come to you some day
and tell you of its successful end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope so,” she replies dreamily, her thoughts far
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have heard nothing more from your sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing.” Her look is frank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can tell you nothing of our plans,” says Ashley,
“further than that our principal endeavor will be to discover
Ernest Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ernest Stanley?” repeats Miss Hathaway. “Oh, the
young man who was pardoned from State prison on
Memorial Day. Do you think he committed the crime?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Frankly, no. But we believe that he knows something
of its perpetration. In other words, we regard him
as the key to the mystery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Derrick Ames?” questions Miss Hathaway, with
the anxious expression of yesterday in her gaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Derrick Ames must be found, also. If you could give
me any information—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can tell you nothing,” she replies hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ralph Felton is another absentee whose presence is
earnestly desired,” he resumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say you do not believe that Stanley is the guilty
man. Does it, then, lie between Ralph Felton and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Derrick Ames?” finishes Ashley. “Not necessarily.
There is another, but for excellent reasons I
should prefer not to mention the name. Have you any
plans for the future?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No definite plans. Mr. Cyrus Felton has been appointed
executor of the estate and after that has been
settled I shall probably make my home at his house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At Cyrus Felton’s?” murmurs Ashley, in such a peculiar
voice that Miss Hathaway looks at him in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; that is the only place I can go to at present. He
has long been a friend of the family.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you no relatives—in Boston, New York, or
elsewhere?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No near relatives. It will not be very long ere I
shall have to make a home for myself. I am told that the
estate will settle for very little,” confesses Miss Hathaway,
with a red spot in each pale cheek. Ashley understands
and regards her sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a short, somewhat embarrassing silence. Then
Ashley rises regretfully. He says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid it must be good-bye—or, perhaps, au
revoir. I shall hope to see you again before the summer
is gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust so,” Miss Hathaway responds, this time quite
cordially, as she gives him her hand at parting, and Ashley
holds it an instant longer than ordinary courtesy calls
for. And as he walks slowly away from the house he
carries with him the vision of a tall girl, with a pure
white face and sad blue eyes, into which the sunlight
will some day come again.</p>

<p class='c011'>At night he and Barker take the Montreal express
for New York.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Summer drifts into autumn and autumn into winter.
Life goes on much the same in Raymond. The Hathaway
mystery gradually fades from public interest, and it
is set down as a crime that will never be explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Raymond National Bank has closed its doors.
The robbery of its vault was a blow from which it found
it impossible to recover.</p>

<p class='c011'>No tidings are received of Derrick Ames and Helen
Hathaway or of Ralph Felton. None, unless they are
in the keeping of the silent, stern-faced Cyrus Felton or
the beautiful girl with the sad blue eyes who abides under
his roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every Sunday, in rain or in sunshine, mid heat or cold,
Louise Hathaway may be seen ascending the hill in the
little cemetery by which Wild River sings its way, her
mission of love to deposit a basket of flowers upon a
grave at the head of which stands a plain white shaft
bearing, besides the name and dates, the simple inscription,
“Faithful Unto Death.”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>SHADOWS OF COMING EVENTS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It is early in the evening. Jack Ashley is seated at
his desk in the Hemisphere office enjoying his pipe
preliminary to setting forth on an assignment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The month is March. Nearly a year has elapsed since
Ashley’s first visit to the Vermont town which, for a
brief space, came into the world’s eye as the scene of
the mysterious death of Cashier Roger Hathaway in
the Raymond National Bank. During this time no further
light has been shed on the mystery, which has gradually
dropped from the thoughts of all save a few persons,
two of whom are Ashley and John Barker, the
detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack hears from Barker occasionally. The latter is
busy on other work, but he still keeps a live interest in
what he regards as the case of his life, and both he and
his newspaper colaborer hope some day to astonish Vermont,
and incidentally the country, by solving the Hathaway
mystery, one of the most remarkable in the criminal
annals of New England.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as the months slipped by Ashley’s stock of confidence
decreased slightly and to-night finds him wondering
whether he will ever have the privilege of handing
the news editor a bundle of “copy,” with the remark
“There is an exclusive that is worth while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have helped run down a number of crimes and
fasten them upon the guilty persons,” he soliloquizes,
“and have flattered myself that I was something of a detective.
But in each of those cases the trembling villain
was on or about the scene of his crime and when you
had your case made out all there was to do was to clap
a heavy hand upon his shoulder. But in this Hathaway
drama about all of the leading characters have disappeared,
and the man whom we regard as the key to the
mystery, Ernest Stanley, is the very man we are least
likely to find.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is Stanley the key?” continues Jack, stretching
himself in his chair. “I don’t think Barker and I have
attached sufficient importance to that blotter found on
Hathaway’s desk. These fragments of sentences keep
haunting me, even amid my daily duties. Something tells
me that if we had the imprint of an entire page of that
letter to Felton we could solve the mystery without finding
our men. ‘These things I charge you, Cyrus Felton,
fail not at the peril of your good name.’ ‘These
things—’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is slowly scratching a match to relight his pipe,
when he suddenly stops and his thought-wrinkled forehead
smooths.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello! Here’s an idea, perhaps a valuable one. It
is possible that Barker and I have been all wrong in
regarding that letter as an accusation. The English
language is elastic. ‘I charge you, Cyrus Felton,’—‘I
charge you, I charge you, I charge you.’ Now, instead
of ‘I accuse you,’ read ‘I adjure you.’ But ‘I adjure you,’
what? To ‘fail not.’ To ‘fail not’ in what? Ay, there’s
the rub. I am as much in the dark as before. Still the
idea is worth considering, and I’ll spring it on Barker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley finishes his smoke in silence and when the last
flake of tobacco has yielded its solace he draws on his
coat and boards an uptown car.</p>

<p class='c011'>In that brilliantly lighted section of Broadway where
stands the Hoffman House, Jack stops a moment to chat
with an acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say,” remarks the latter, “there’s a chap yonder staring
hard at you. Know him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At his friend’s suggestion Ashley turns suddenly and
catches the searching gaze of a tall, handsome man with
a dark-brown beard trimmed to a point. He is richly
but simply attired, and his appearance is unmistakably
that of a gentleman. As Ashley returns his stare with interest
the stranger turns and enters the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The incident is trivial, but it awakens curious emotions
in Ashley, and absently overlooking his acquaintance’s
suggestion of a visit to the cafe, he says an au
revoir and continues up Broadway.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen those eyes somewhere,” he muses, “but
hang me if I can recall where.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As, late in the evening, his assignment covered, Ashley
is sauntering down Broadway, he is haunted by the
vision of a bearded face surrounding a pair of piercing
eyes. He even drops in at the Hoffman House and
looks through the bar room, cafe and reading rooms,
but the handsome stranger is not in view.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has been in Raymond once since he left it,
the spring before, and he was kindly received by Miss
Hathaway. But that was all. Not all his engaging manners
and clever conversation could penetrate the reserve
with which she surrounded herself, and he almost decided
that she was indeed the marble which he professed to
Barker to have solely interested him. Still, that pure
white face, with its matchless blue eyes and the sad
smile that occasionally lighted it, lingers vividly in his
memory and will continue to linger until—</p>

<p class='c011'>He is at the Hemisphere office now. A very short time
suffices to write and hand in his “copy” and then he
lounges into the cable editor’s room, with the inquiry:
“What news from over the sea, Chance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing special except the insurrection in Cuba,”
Chance tells him. “Affairs are getting hot down there.
You can judge of the magnitude of to-day’s battle at
Cienfuegos when you read that thirty Spaniards were
killed and fifty captured.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should say so,” laughs Ashley. “The average mortality
per battle is three men killed and four wounded,
is it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cable editor throws a handful of “copy” from him
with a sniff of disgust. “One can never tell how far to
trust this rot we are getting from Madrid and Key West,”
he says. “I wish the Hemisphere had a live man such as
you down in Cuba to give us some straight information
on the conflict.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. I have no desire to run up against Yellow
Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang Yellow Jack! He is only dangerous to those
half-fed raw recruits that the government is sending over
from Spain. I have talked with Mr. Hone about the advantage
of sending a representative to Havana or Santiago,
and he is seriously considering it. Hold on! Here’s
something coming now,” and Chance turns to his table.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley waits until the dispatch has been received, and
then reads with interest the following special from Madrid:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ten thousand additional troops will be dispatched to Cuba
within a week, in response to the demand of Gen. Martinez
de Truenos, the new captain-general of the island. Gen.
Truenos has had experience in fighting Cuban insurgents, and
a speedy termination of the uprising is looked for.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Same old bluff,” comments Ashley, and then, awakened
to an interest in Cuban affairs by the words of the
cable editor, he visits the night-editor’s den in search of
further information.</p>

<p class='c011'>The longest story is from Key West, and a portion of
it runs in this wise:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The insurgents are winning victories every day. The
Cuban patriots do not need more men. All they want is arms
and ammunition.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is whispered that the greatest difficulty with which the
present captain-general has to contend is the conspiring among
his own alleged supporters and advisers. One or two Spanish
generals and a number of influential residents and land-owners
at Havana, Santiago and other important points are suspected
of active sympathy with the insurgents, but no proof of
such complicity can be obtained. It is even said that the
chosen president of the provisional republic is at present in
Cuba, and that under the very nose of the hated oppressor he
directs the movements of the patriot armies. It is thought
that this condition of affairs is responsible for the change in
captain-generals, as Truenos is reputed to be a clever diplomat
as well as a tried soldier. The next few months will
probably decide the fate of the republic. The Cubans must
win this year or never.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“What do you think?” Ashley asks the night editor.
“Has the island any chance of liberty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The prospects were never rosier,” is Chambers’ reply.
“It is evident that the Castilian has an enormous job on
his hands in the present insurrection. We received a dispatch
a short while ago which has a local reference. I
sent it up to Hone, and perhaps Ricker has it by this time.
It states that the insurgents count upon valuable assistance
from New York and that an expedition is being
fitted out here. This wire came from Washington and
the Spanish minister there has asked our government to
prohibit the assistance I speak of. Hello!” as a bunch
of copy is thrown upon his table, “the president has issued
a proclamation bearing on the matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The proclamation is brief but significant. It sets forth
that, without a violation of the friendly relations existing
between Spain and the United States, this government
cannot countenance the fitting out of expeditions designed
to assist the insurrectionists in Cuba. A number of United
States vessels have been ordered to patrol duty, and a
rigid surveillance of the coast will be maintained.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That may be good government, but it is confoundedly
un-American in sentiment,” remarks Ashley, scornfully,
for he is an American through and through.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The government’s course was clear,” Chambers mildly
observes. “The President could do nothing less. I do
not imagine, however, that the patrol will be much more
than perfunctory.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Ashley reports at the Hemisphere office the next
day he finds in his letter box two yellow envelopes. One
is from the city editor and contains an assignment to interview
Senor Rafael Manada of the Cuban revolutionary
society in the United States. The senor is stopping at
the Fifth Avenue and a full story on Cuban affairs from
the New York end is wanted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well this is something new, at any rate,” thinks Jack,
and he tears open the second envelope. This contains
a dispatch dated from Raymond, Vt., the night before,
and Ashley whistles softly as he comprehends the concise
but thoroughly interesting contents:</p>

<p class='c013'>“See you to-morrow afternoon at your office. I have found
Hathaway’s revolver. Barker.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE BEGINNING OF THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Don Rafael Manada? Yes, sir! Front, show the
gentleman to No. 48.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A few minutes later Ashley is ushered into one of the
most sumptuous and expensive suites in the big hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>He bows gracefully to the tall gentleman who advances
to meet his visitor, bearing in his hand the card that has
preceded him. Don Rafael is a man at whom even the
least observant would be likely to take a second glance.
Of perhaps 40 years of age, his hair of raven hue and
unusual abundance is still unflecked by gray. The face is
of olive hue, cleanly shaven save as to heavy mustachios,
which by an odd freak of nature are snow white; heavy
eyebrows of the same hue as the hair surmount eyes of
piercing brilliancy; a long, aquiline nose, lips and mouth
a trifle too sensuous for the rest of the features, complete
a singularly interesting countenance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You came from the Hemisphere?” queries Don Manada,
in melodious tones, with hardly a trace of the Castilian
accent. “I am pleased to greet a representative of
that great journal, whose influence is always cast on the
side of right and justice. I read with the deepest emotions
of gratitude this morning an editorial in your journal
protesting against the proclamation which the administration
has issued against the fitting out of expeditions
designed to aid the insurrection in Cuba. Your paper
properly urged that the United States government should
recognize the Cubans as belligerents. Ah, my dear sir,
could that be done, Cuba would be a free republic within
the twelvemonth,” finishes Manada, enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was to secure an expression of opinion from you
on the outlook in Cuba and the preparations being made
in this country that I have been commissioned to interview
you, Don Rafael,” says Jack Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything that it would be proper for me to say, as the
agent of the Cuban revolutionary party, I shall be glad
to give,” continues Manada, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now the Cuban patriot becomes imbued with nervous
energy as he reverts to the absorbing hope and ambition
of his life—the freedom of Cuba. He paces the floor
with erect, military tread, as he speaks rapidly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This war is not a capricious attempt to found an independence
more to be feared than useful. It is the cordial
congregation of Cubans of various origin, who are convinced
that, in the conquest of liberty, rather than abject
abasement, are acquired the virtues necessary to maintain
our freedom. This is no race war.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the Spanish inhabitants of Cuba the revolutionists
expect to find such affectionate neutrality or material aid,
that through them the war will be shorter, its disasters
less and the subsequent peace more easy and friendly.
We Cubans began the war; the Cubans and Spanish together
will terminate it. If they do not ill-treat us, we
will not ill-treat them. Let them respect and they will
be respected. Steel will answer to steel and friendship
to friendship. In the bosom of the son of the Antilles
there is no hatred, and the Cuban salutes in death the
Spaniard whom the cruelty of a conscript army tore from
his home and hearth and brought over to assassinate in
many bosoms the freedom to which he himself aspires.
But rather than salute him in death the revolutionists
would like to welcome him in life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good, indeed, Don Manada,” comments Ashley
as he hastily jots down a skeleton of the impassioned
words of the Cuban.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, to leave generalities,” says Jack, “upon what
specific elements of strength, or of weakness on your
opponents’ part do you base your hopes of ultimate
success?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada smiles. “All our elements of strength, nor all
the Spanish sources of weakness, we may not divulge yet.
First, and of this I believe you newspaper men need not
be assured, the information that comes from Cuba or
from Madrid is entirely untrustworthy, distorted, colored
and manufactured to suit Spanish ideas and hopes. It
tells you that the insurrection is limited to three or four
provinces. Yet you will notice to-day’s dispatches from
Madrid state that a blockade of every port of Cuba is
imminent, large and small, and an additional squadron of
ten Spanish gunboats has been dispatched from Cadiz
to aid the big fleet now patrolling Cuban waters. Think
you that the Madrid government would declare that
blockade if the insurrection were limited to three or four
paltry provinces? Bah! I can assure you, while they may
not now be ready or willing to declare themselves, yet
touch every Cuban in the heart, let him whisper to you his
sentiments, and you will find them to a man praying for
the success of the revolution. You Americans, in the full
enjoyment of true liberty, can form but a faint idea of the
real situation in Cuba. Imagine a land where no one
is free to write or say anything except what the government
judges deem proper! Imagine a government ever
ready to throw you into prison, confiscate your property,
bring ruin to everything that is dear to you on earth, and
to set over you a Spaniard to watch your acts, almost
your thoughts! That is the way we live in Cuba. Of
late the number of these spies has been increased by
hordes. They are not all men. Some of them—and the
shrewdest and most harmful to our cause—are women,
who ingratiate themselves with prominent revolutionists,
sometimes becoming possessed of invaluable plans,
which they promptly reveal to the Spanish government.
It is believed that some of these women are located in
cities in the United States, where it is thought their presence
may be useful to spy upon the movements of the
friends of Cuba in this country. But of course that is a
game two can play at, and we ourselves are not wholly
unaware of the secret plans of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reference has been made in some of the dispatches
from Key West, Don Manada, to the fact that the revolutionists
have become possessed of a steamer which has
been remarkably successful in evading the Spanish cruisers
and landing men and ammunition from the Dominican
and Florida coasts?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada’s lip curls scornfully at Ashley’s use of the
word “evading.” Then he smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you happen to read in any of the press dispatches
an account of the loss of the Spanish man-of-war Mercedes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has seen a casual reference to the disaster.
“She ran on a reef near the Great Exuma, while pursuing
a suspected filibustering steamer, did she not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Mercedes was sunk in forty fathoms of water
in fair and open fight with the Cuban cruiser Pearl of
the Antilles,” in slow and measured tones responds Manada,
his black eyes glittering. “The Spanish government
has strenuously sought to conceal that fact, but it
has leaked out, and only yesterday I received from
Le Director de la Guerra a copy of El Terredo’s
report of the battle. Ah, that was glorious! The
Mercedes went down in less than seven minutes,
while the Pearl was unharmed. Senor Ashley, we have
to thank the inventive genius of your countrymen for the
success of our gallant cruiser, for El Terredo states that
it was the wonderful effectiveness of the new dynamite
cannon and the Yankee gunner that accomplished the
feat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s unfailing scent for news assures him that this
interview is good for at least a two-column leader in the
Hemisphere. Here is information that will make a sensation
in the morning. The American public has been
wholly in the dark as to this new element in the insurrection,
this Cuban cruiser, with her patent dynamite gun
and Yankee gunner, that has destroyed one of the most
powerful of Spain’s cruisers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“El Terredo? Is he the captain of the Pearl of the Antilles,
Don Manada?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is, and one of the bravest and most successful of
our commanders on land as well as sea. Why, there is
not a cruiser of the Spanish navy now in Cuban waters
that alone would dare engage the Pearl! They are well
aware of her prowess and the skill and bravery of her
commander, whom they have rightly named ‘El Terredo,’
‘the terror.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we have other plans the details of which cannot
be revealed. Do you remember how the sinking of De
Gama’s Brazilian ironclad was effected in the revolution
in that country? It did not require another man-of-war
to destroy her. Only a little instrument less than five feet
in length—whish! boom!—and the resistless water is
gushing in a torrent through the sides of the ironclad.
Ah, warfare is different in these modern days, Senor Ashley,
and victory does not always rest on the side of the
heaviest guns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is said in a Washington dispatch, Don Manada,
that the Spanish minister has received information that a
formidable filibustering expedition is about to leave this
city for Cuba. Have you any knowledge of the fact?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada shrugs his shoulders. “Quien sabe? Are not
all vessels clearing for any port obliged to obtain papers
stating their destination? And does not the President’s
proclamation warn against the shipping of arms and ammunition
to Cuba from American ports? But of this be
assured—Cuban patriots will not be without arms and
ammunition to bring this war to a successful conclusion.
It is true that is what we most need now. Ammunition
especially is not as plentiful as we could wish, but had
we none at all, with his trusty machete a Cuban patriot is
more than a match for a brace of the puny, boyish conscripts
Spain is sending to find early graves on Cuban
soil. In the battle of Siguanoa, of which also I have just
received an authentic account, our comrades finally
charged with their machetes, which they handle with
wonderful skill, and completely routed the Spanish troops.
The actual fighting masses of the revolutionists, senor,
the soldados raso, are no mean soldiers, even from a
northerner’s point of view. And they are not all Cuban
born or Spanish born who have settled in Cuba and become
identified with the island. You would be surprised,
I doubt not, to learn that not a few of your own nationality
are fighting for human liberty on the side of the revolutionists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the character of the Spanish officers?” inquires
Ashley, getting more and more interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada frowns. “Gen. Truenos, the new captain-general,
we know as yet only by reputation. His chief of
staff, the Madrid papers state, is to be Gen. Murillo, who
is now in this country—in this city, if I mistake not. He
poses as a diplomat and is the head of the spy bureau.
Of the other leading Spanish officers in Cuba, they are of
the usual foreign-service character. Some veterans, some
young and inexperienced, seeking to win laurels in this
war, a few Spanish noblemen, whom the exigencies of the
family purse have forced into the army. By the way, attached
to the new captain-general’s staff, I learn there is
a young American, a sugar planter. His name, I am told,
was Felton, but he changed it to Alvarez. More Spanish,
you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Felton! A question is on Ashley’s tongue, when the
utter absurdity of connecting Ralph Felton’s identity
with that of a young Cuban planter occurs to him and he
refrains.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Don Manada, I am obliged to you for the half-hour
you have accorded me, and I only hope your words
will have as convincing an effect on the readers of the
Hemisphere as they have had on me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Senor Ashley. I shall ever be pleased
to meet you when your duties may oblige you to seek one
of the Cuban revolutionary party. Adios.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” remarks the interviewer to himself, as he stops
a moment to strengthen his memory by a fresh Havana,
“if my friend of the bleached mustachios is not a rainbow
chaser of the latest approved political character, Gen.
Truenos and the Spanish army—and navy, too—have
considerable work cut out for them in the vicinity of the
Caribbean Sea. Hello!” he exclaims, staring at a graceful
figure that is crossing Twenty-third Street in his
direction. “If that isn’t Miss Louise Hathaway of Raymond,
Vt., my memory for faces is entirely destroyed.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A CUP OF CHOCOLATE AT MAILLARD’S.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“It is Miss Hathaway!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Mr. Ashley!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I am not quite forgotten,” smiles Jack, as he
takes the little black-gloved hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgotten? Ah, no, indeed. I was only startled to
meet one familiar face amid this never-ending procession
of strangers. But this, I presume, is your native heath,
Mr. Ashley? How do you carry the memory of so many
faces?” as Ashley bows for the dozenth time toward the
stream of pedestrians.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a part of our business, Miss Hathaway. A
newspaper man acquires a passing acquaintance with all
classes of society. But to drop shop talk, tell me of Raymond
and of yourself. I feel quite an interest in the quaint
old town. Here is Maillard’s close by. Suppose we drop
in and have a cup of chocolate. Oh, it is quite the thing,”
smiles Jack, as Miss Hathaway hesitates a moment.
“Everybody goes to Maillard’s after a shopping tour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, as we are in Rome, we must imitate the Romans,”
she acquiesces. “For surely these bundles must be
quite sufficient to convict me of having been shopping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When she is snugly ensconced in an alcove, with a
steaming cup of the beverage so dear to the feminine
heart before her, Jack studies her face across the tiny
table.</p>

<p class='c011'>More beautiful if that were possible, than ever, he decides,
watching the shifting color in the rounded cheek;
with more animation—yes, decidedly more animation;
quite a different being from the doubly bereaved daughter
of the dead cashier of nearly a year ago. But what
is she doing in New York? thinks Jack, with a sudden
twinge in the cardiac region that astonishes even himself.
It cannot be that she has heard from Derrick Ames, and
besides, her sister—What rot, he mentally concludes,
as the subject of his thoughts suddenly looks up and
catches his puzzled expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway’s eyes twinkle. “Has it just occurred
to you that you have left your pocketbook at home?” she
asks. “Your expression was just such as the humorous
artists attach to the subjects of such unfortunate contretemps.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but that seldom does happen in real life, Miss
Hathaway. No; my sole earthly possessions are at this
moment resting securely in the bottom of one small
pocket. But what lucky chance brought you within
range of my defective vision on Broadway this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I have been a dweller in the metropolis since last
Saturday. We, that is Mr. Felton and myself, are en
route to Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Cuba! Pardon me, but why to that war-racked
isle? You see, I have just returned from interviewing a
native of Cuba on the situation there, and his description
hardly makes it out as a desirable watering-place just at
present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway laughs, a trifle nervously. “Perhaps
it is rather an odd place to go this spring, and while I
had a great desire to visit the country I really had no
serious idea of gratifying the wish. But one evening
while I was thinking of the matter, Mr. Felton suddenly
asked me how I would like to go to Cuba. I said I would
be delighted to go to escape the chill winds of March,
and to my great surprise he suggested that we make
preparations and start at once for New York. So here
we are, and on Saturday we sail for tropic climes. But
do you think there is any danger to Americans traveling
in Cuba? I thought—I had read—that the disturbances
were limited to some of the far inland districts and that
there was no trouble in Havana and the larger cities.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley pulls his mustache thoughtfully. “No, I do not
see how there can be possible danger for you,” he says at
last. “Be sure, to avoid any possible annoyance, to get
your passports before leaving New York. By Jove,” he
murmurs under his breath, “if the Hemisphere should
send a man to Cuba, and I that man—well, that wouldn’t
be half-bad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why should Mr. Felton desire to go to Cuba?”
Ashley asks. “I fancied all his interests were in Vermont.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He says that he has some property that requires his
attention there, a sugar plantation, I fancy, or something
of the sort. Anyway, he is quite anxious to go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A sugar plantation in Cuba! Jack draws a long
breath and his active mind reverts to his interview with
Don Manada. Felton-Alvarez of the captain-general’s
staff, a young American planter! The son has evidently
forsworn his country and by joining the Spanish army
has become a Spanish citizen. Therefore he undoubtedly
cannot be extradited. But the father?</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long does Mr. Felton contemplate remaining in
Cuba?” Ashley asks, carelessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will depend upon his inclinations and the condition
of his business affairs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That means indefinitely,” Jack thinks. “Cyrus Felton
must not go to Cuba!” Then aloud: “Miss Hathaway,
pardon me if I revive unpleasant memories, but
the deep personal interest I took in the case must be my
apology. Have you heard from your sister—since—since
the tragedy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Miss Hathaway is silent, her face clouding
with the sad thoughts of that last fateful Memorial
Day. “Mr. Ashley,” she says at last, looking him full in
the face, “I have received two letters from my sister
Helen. She is well, and I trust happy. She was married
in this city the day after they—she—left Raymond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Derrick Ames?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Louise nods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they now residing in the city?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; they are not now in this country—I should say
this part of the country,” she adds, hastily.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment a silence falls and both absently sip their
chocolate, busy with their thoughts. Then Ashley remarks,
smilingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Apropos of nothing, Miss Hathaway, did you ever
hear of the great French ball, the annual terpsichorean
revel of Gotham?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly, I have read about it. I gather that it is
not always strictly—well, not exactly in the same category
with the patriarchs’ ball.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—not precisely,” admits Ashley. “What I was
leading up to is this: I suppose I shall be assigned to
do the ball for the Hemisphere to-morrow evening—I
have done it for the last two years—and a friend of mine
kindly presented to me a pocketful of tickets. Now, I
know you would enjoy looking in on the brilliant scene
for an hour or two in the early part of the evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Mr. Ashley, I really do not see how we could.
It would hardly be proper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not perhaps to mingle with the rush, but as a casual
looker-on in Verona the propriety could scarcely be
questioned. A mask, a box where you could sit and
listen to the really good music and watch the glitter and
gayety, I believe you would recall the hour whiled away
as one of thorough enjoyment. Besides—and here is the
selfish part of my proposition—it would render the affair
less of an old story to me. You must really say ‘yes,’”
persists Ashley, as Miss Hathaway hesitates, with the inevitable
result.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if Mr. Felton is willing to pose as a ‘chaperon’
for a brief space, perhaps I may consent to assist the
Hemisphere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I assure you that that appreciative journal will be
deeply grateful. Where shall I call for your ultimatum?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are stopping at the St. James. And now I must
hurry home to examine my purchases. Thank you so
much for your kindness, Mr. Ashley. I am so glad to
have met you again. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Au revoir—until the morrow,” Jack responds, as Miss
Hathaway’s elegant figure threads its way through the
throng. “I wonder what the straight-laced Vermont
maiden would say if she could look into the wine-room
of the garden about an hour before the French ball makes
its last kick. But she won’t, though. The first hour or
two of the function is as decorous as an afternoon tea on
Fifth Avenue—rather more so, I fancy. And now to
the office to fire the Cuban heart with Don Manada’s
screed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But seated at his desk at the Hemisphere office, Ashley’s
thoughts persist in straying away from the yellow
sheets he is rapidly covering with the Manada interview.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Raymond tragedy mingles with thoughts of Cuba.
His previously conceived ideas are undergoing a decided
metamorphosis. The knowledge that the elder Felton
is going to Cuba, where his son, according to the description
of Manada, is apparently settled, and for a long
period, if not forever, suggests to the newspaper man the
conclusion that Mr. Felton must have been aware of his
son’s movements since the sudden departure from Raymond;
may even have counseled that flight. Nay, more,
that father and son are jointly implicated in the death of
Cashier Hathaway. The theory just evolved grows
stronger the more Jack considers the circumstances. On
Cyrus Felton, then, depends the unraveling of the mystery.
And he left Raymond suddenly, according to Miss
Hathaway’s admission. Barker, judging from his message
on the finding of the revolver, must have been in
Raymond before or during the departure of Cyrus Felton.
Is it not possible, then, that the ex-bank president became
possessed of the knowledge that Barker is again
actively at work on the case; that he further became
aware that Barker had, or was likely to get, some important
clew, such as the discovery of the revolver, for instance;
that he considered discretion the better part of
valor and determined to flee the country and join his son
in Cuba?</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s busy pen ceases to skim over the paper for a
moment, as he rears this dazzling edifice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I have struck the bull’s-eye,” he reflects.
“If only Barker has a little more evidence to back up
the finding of the revolver, Miss Hathaway may not take
that trip to Cuba after all—at least, not with her present
amiable traveling companion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A few moments later the big batch of copy, the result
of Ashley’s visit to Don Manada, is tossed upon the desk
of the city editor. Then, still preoccupied and unusually
untalkative for jovial Jack Ashley, the interviewer has
again drawn on overcoat and gloves and is leaving the
entrance to the Hemisphere office when a hand is dropped
on his shoulder, as Detective Barker earnestly greets
him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re just the man I want to see. Where can we
indulge in a quiet talk for half an hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come right up to the cable editor’s room. He won’t
be in for an hour or two.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>BARKER DECIDES TO STRIKE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Well, my boy,” begins Barker, “it’s a long lane that
has no turn, and I think we have reached the beginning
of the end of this Hathaway mystery. There is the
weapon that sent Roger Hathaway to eternity Memorial
Day of last year,” handing it to Ashley, with a complacent
air. “I am not a betting man, or I would wager a
reasonable sum that, ere the anniversary of the crime
rolls around, the murderer will be safely incarcerated
in the Mansfield County jail in Vermont.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley examines curiously the weapon Barker has produced.
It is an ordinary 32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson
revolver, of the bull-dog variety, covered with rust, and
all of the five chambers, with possibly one exception, contain
unused cartridges.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there is one empty chamber,” responds Barker,
as Ashley attempts ineffectually to turn the rusty cylinder,
“and that sent poor old Hathaway out of the world. And
now I will tell you of some important clews that I have
succeeded in running down since I saw you last.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know I subscribed for the Raymond local newspaper,
and a mighty good investment that $1.25 proved.
Week before last the paper contained a local item about
a boy’s finding a revolver on the bank of Wild River.
It was only a ten-to-one shot that the revolver picked up
by the river bank was Hathaway’s missing gun, but I
took the short end and posted off to Raymond. The
result of my trip you now hold in your hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The little chap who found the revolver had picked it
up close to the opposite bank from which it had been
thrown. It was quite a stretch beyond the deep pool
that we explored. You see I was fully a hundred yards
from Felton when he hurled the revolver into the stream,
and I miscalculated the force he put into the throw. His
feeling of loathing for the hateful weapon was such that
he hurled it nearly across the river. Even then, it would
have been covered by two or three feet of water had not
the river been dammed last fall, a few rods above the
place, to furnish power for a sawmill. That left only an
inch or two of water over the revolver, and little Jimmy
Jones, or whatever his name was, found it there while
prowling about the river bank. It is Roger Hathaway’s
revolver, too, beyond a doubt. I had Sibley, who was
teller of the bank, and who has seen it in Hathaway’s
desk a thousand times, examine it, and he positively
identifies it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So far, so good. That revolver rivets a mighty strong
link, I take it, to the chain we have already forged about
Cyrus Felton. But the situation had become somewhat
complicated, I found after I secured possession of the
revolver. Felton has skipped from Raymond, taking the
Hathaway girl with him, and evidently does not intend
to return for some time, if indeed at all. Consequently
our next and most imperative duty is to find where he
now is and see that he does not get beyond our reach.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can do that in five minutes,” Ashley quietly assures
the detective. “Cyrus Felton and Miss Louise Hathaway
are now at the St. James hotel in this city. They
sail for Cuba next Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good,” remarks the phlegmatic Barker. “That is
luck on a par with finding the revolver. But when Cyrus
Felton leaves New York it will be to go back to Vermont.
Bound for Cuba, eh? Why did he select that
country instead of Europe, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because his son is in Cuba. Barker, I opine that it
will be necessary for both of us to revise our theories of
the murder,” continues Ashley. “In the judgment of the
undersigned, both Feltons, father and son, are equally
implicated in that crime. As to which actually fired the
fatal shot, I am not prepared to say. But I am confident
that both were in the bank when Hathaway was shot. I
learned to-day that there is a young American, a planter,
in Cuba who has joined the Spanish army as an officer on
the staff of the captain-general. His name is, or was,
Felton. Now comes the senior Felton, en route to Cuba.
Why should he go to Cuba just at this time while the
island is in the throes of insurrection? He tells Miss
Hathaway that he has business interests there—a sugar
plantation. Isn’t it clear that he is going to join his son?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker taps his forehead reflectively. “The idea is
plausible,” he admits. “But what in the name of the
great hornspoon is he taking Miss Hathaway there for?
It isn’t possible that he is so cold-blooded, so absolutely
devoid of conscience, that he would wed the daughter of
the man he had slain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Decidedly not,” returns Ashley, with very like a snort
of disgust at the suggestion of the possibility of Louise
Hathaway becoming Cyrus Felton’s wife. “Miss Hathaway
is Felton’s ward, and of course he is obliged to take
her with him. Besides she herself is anxious to go to
Cuba. She told me so this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anxious to go herself, eh?” repeats Barker. “Well,
there is no accounting for tastes. I think if I were going
on a pleasure trip, however, I should select some other
spot than that home of Yellow Jack and the machete.
But”—the detective’s forehead is wrinkled in thought—“you
don’t suppose she has any friends in Cuba whom
she is anxious to see—her sister or Derrick Ames?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley considers this possibility a moment. “It is possible,”
he exclaims. “She admitted she had received letters
from her sister, who was well and happy—but not in
this country, she said at first, and then changed it to ‘not
in this section of the country.’ Ames and her sister may
be in Cuba, as well as Ralph Felton; but not, I will
wager a good deal, in the same vicinity—not, at least,
if Ames knows it. Barker, it seems to me that instead
of this matter becoming simplified it is daily growing
more complicated. The thing for us to do is to cut the
Gordian knot at once and bring matters to a climax.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is only one way to do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. Arrest Cyrus Felton, and charge him with
being the murderer of Roger Hathaway, or an accomplice
before or after the act.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker picks up the revolver again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have got a good deal of strong evidence against
him,” he says, slowly; “yet I should like to get the son in
the same net. With the two of them jointly accused
and jointly tried I am certain we could unravel the mystery.
I have evidence against the elder Felton that I
have not yet told you; in fact, what I consider as a sufficient
motive for the crime. The absence of a good,
healthy motive, you know, was the weak link in our chain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The president of those two banks, I am convinced,
was short in his accounts with both institutions. In other
words, he had used the bank’s securities to tide over his
own financial affairs, which I have discovered, were not
in the flourishing condition supposed. Although he was
aware that Felton’s accounts were overdrawn, as was
evidenced by the writing on the blotter, Hathaway was
apparently ignorant of the fact that the president had
taken many of the bank’s securities and hypothecated
them for his own account. That was done by the president
through the connivance of his son, the bookkeeper.
Get the idea?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley nods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now then: You will recall that Cyrus Felton told
you, after the murder, that nearly $50,000 in available
cash and about half as much more in securities had been
stolen. He testified at the inquest that some securities
had been taken. My theory is that not one single one
of those securities was taken from the bank that night.
’Cause why? Because they had previously been extracted
by Cyrus Felton and his son. And the cash?
That, I believe was Ralph Felton’s share for his part in
the tragedy. Perhaps father and son had planned for
the latter to rob the bank that night—the former anxious
for the covering up of the loss of the securities, the latter
covetous of the money. The time was drawing near
when the annual examination of the savings bank was
due. It was to have taken place in June. Then the discovery
that many of the ‘jackets’ that should contain
securities were empty was inevitable. But Cashier Hathaway
was at the bank that night. The son may have
been concealed in that closet, awaiting his opportunity.
The cashier, no longer willing to permit the president’s
overdrafts, wrote that imperative note to Cyrus Felton.
The latter visited the bank. An altercation ensued.
Heated words were uttered. Hathaway may have discovered
the loss of the securities. The president and
cashier, old men both, engaged in a scuffle. Perhaps the
president sought to wrest the key to the vault from the
cashier’s hands. At any rate, a struggle. Ralph Felton
leaped from his hiding-place, and seizing the cashier’s
revolver, which he knew was kept in the desk, rushed
to the assistance of his father. The fatal shot, and—father
and son gazed in dismay at each other across the dead
body of the faithful cashier. The rest is simple of explanation—the
rifling of the vault and the subsequent flight
of the son. Ashley, that is my revised theory of the murder
of Roger Hathaway. What do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is worthy of your perspecuity, Barker, and in some
respects it appears flawless. Yet—well, sometimes I
have a sort of intuition that we are off the right track
altogether. Ah, Barker, if we could but find that chap
I saw in the bushes that morning, Ernest Stanley.
Now that you have revised your theory, and in the light
of recent developments, I feel more than ever that Stanley
possesses the key that will unlock the inner doors of
the mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“However, that is neither here nor there, for Ernest
Stanley has as completely vanished as though the earth
had opened and swallowed him up. It is almost inexplicable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No stranger than the fading away of Derrick Ames
and Helen Hathaway. You know we traced them to this
city, and the most searching investigation by both the
metropolitan police and our own men could not find them
or ascertain for a certainty whether they went west or
east.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But to return to the Feltons. Those two missing
leaves from the bank ledger could a tale unfold, I fancy,
in relation to Cyrus Felton’s precise relations with the
bank. Yes, on the whole, I believe we have sufficient
evidence to strike. He is at the St. James, you say? I
guess I had better arrest him at once, and then, if he declines
to go back to Vermont without extradition papers,
I can proceed to Montpelier to-morrow and get the necessary
documents in season to start back to Raymond
by Friday—unlucky day for him, I fancy. Well, old
man, you will have to spill a whole bottle of ink on this,
I suppose. Will you spring the full story in the
morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack starts suddenly. “By Jove!” he exclaims, looking
at the detective, with a rueful glance, “it seems like a
brutally cold-blooded thing to say, but do you know, I
have invited Felton and Miss Hathaway to look in on
the French ball to-morrow evening, and now—if the
deed wasn’t an apparent refinement of cruelty, I would
ask you to postpone the arrest of Felton till day after to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are positive he does not contemplate sailing for
Cuba till Saturday?” inquires Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So Miss Hathaway said. And, yes.” Jack’s eye has
run hastily down the advertised dates of sailings in the
Hemisphere. “The Mallory Line steamer, City of Callao,
sails for Havana and the West Indies on Saturday. That
is the steamer they are evidently booked for. But to
make assurance doubly sure I will telephone to the office
of the steamship line and ascertain if staterooms have
been secured for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker nods approvingly at the precaution.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” the reply comes over the wire, “Mr. Cyrus
Felton and Miss Hathaway are booked for the Callao.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Havana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; for Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That settles that, then,” observes Barker, cheerfully.
“Felton can enjoy his little fling at the garden, and subsequently
have something to think about while he awaits
the action of the grand jury.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Inured as he is to tragic scenes and happenings, Jack
winces slightly at thought of the part he expects to play
in acting as the “guide, philosopher and friend” of Cyrus
Felton on probably his last night of liberty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way,” he remarks, “you said Felton had made
preparations for an extended absence from Raymond.
Did he cause that to become generally known in the
town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Per contra, as the lawyers say, no one in Raymond
had any idea that he contemplated a trip to Cuba, understanding
that he is off on a business trip to New York.
A little judicious investigation revealed the fact that he
had quietly severed every business tie that should connect
him with Raymond. Even his house, I found, he has
mortgaged to the chimneys, and then leased for a period
of ten years to a western man, to whom, by the way, he
has disposed of his interest in the quarries. His share
in the bank block he sold two months ago, taking a mortgage
for two-thirds the purchase price, but this mortgage
he last week transferred to the Vermont Life Insurance
Company, receiving cash therefor. Even his
horses have been shipped to Boston and sold. All this
Felton has accomplished so quietly that, as I said before,
no one in Raymond suspects that he is not as deeply interested
financially in the town as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, on the whole,” finishes Barker, “I am glad we
have concluded to postpone the arrest a couple of days,
for I have some personal matters I must attend to.
What have you on hand to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just an hour or so at the Madison Square Garden.
Come to dinner with me and we’ll go to the Garden
together. I want to talk this matter over further,” says
Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker acquiesces, and as the newspaper man leads the
way to the street he murmurs to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“So the blow falls on Wednesday. Well, it will make
one of the most interesting ‘beats’ in the history of the
Hemisphere and I guess I had better begin on the story
to-night.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>PHILLIP VAN ZANDT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“What are they playing now, Phillip?” Isabel Harding
draws the program to her and scans the musical numbers
listed thereon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it possible that you do not recognize the immortal
unfinished Schubert symphony?” her companion asks,
with good-natured sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know I cannot tell one symphony from another,”
Mrs. Harding remarks, pettishly. “I wish you would
pay less attention to the music and more to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phillip Van Zandt smiles, but makes no reply to this reproach.
And while he listens intently to the divine
music which the orchestra is making, his companion sips
her claret punch with a pretty frown upon her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place is Madison Square Garden; the occasion, one
of a series of classical concerts which Mr. Walter Damrosch
and his orchestra are furnishing New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two—Mrs. Harding and Mr. Van Zandt—are sitting
by the wall in a comparatively uncrowded section of
the Garden and more than one person who glances at
them remarks that they are a handsome couple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phillip Van Zandt is not far from 30 years of age.
There is nothing effeminate about his singularly handsome
face; the closely trimmed brown beard does not
conceal the firm, almost hard lines about the mouth.
A mass of dark-brown curls cluster about a noble forehead
that fronts a well-shaped head. But the striking
features of the face are the eyes. Something inscrutable
lurks in their dark-brown depths, now dreamy and tender,
and again cold and glittering.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who he is and what he is are points upon which his
nearest acquaintances—he has no intimate friends—have
never succeeded in satisfying themselves. He came
somewhere out of the West less than a year ago. He
occupies luxurious quarters at the Wyoming apartment
house, spends money freely, and seems to be drifting
through existence with the insouciance of a man who
has lived his life and who looks forward to nothing this
side of Charon’s ferry—or perhaps beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>He plays at cards and plunges at the track and wins
or loses with the inevitable composure which characterizes
his every action. To men he is cold, often insolent;
to women he is indifferent, although infinitely courteous.
Handsome, distingue, wealthy, witty in a dry, cynical
sort of way, he is a man who could be immensely popular
with his fellows and fascinating to the other sex. That
he is neither one nor the other is his peculiarity.</p>

<p class='c011'>His companion of this evening, Isabel Harding, is a
personage, who would attract instant attention in a crowd
of attractive women. She is magnificently proportioned—a
splendid animal, as Van Zandt remarked when first
his careless gaze rested upon her. Her hair is black as
midnight; her eyes, large and lustrous, can either flash
with the fury of the tiger or beam with the softness of
the dove. Her mouth is somewhat large, but it is firm,
and between full, scarlet lips gleam two arcs of strong,
milk-white teeth.</p>

<p class='c011'>She has known occasions when propriety was not
finically insisted upon, but on this night she is as demure
as innocence at 16. For she knows Van Zandt well
enough to understand that, while virtue and worth may
not interest him, viciousness and unworthiness decidedly
do not. And the least discerning student of human
nature can see that she loves him—loves him blindly,
madly, and—hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt cares nothing for her, save in his indifferent
way, and she knows it. But she does not despair. She
is a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhere in Bohemia, Van Zandt met Isabel Harding.
She interested him, she was so unlike the other
women at the little French restaurant where he had
dropped in to get lunch and a bottle of really good wine.
Some small service by him rendered sufficed to establish
between the two a camaraderie that continued until
the present. It witnessed no alteration of sentiment on
the part of Van Zandt. But Isabel—she began by admiring
and finished by worshiping.</p>

<p class='c011'>He never asked who or what she was, although she
was obviously a woman with a story to tell. She was a
widow, she said. Widows are many in Bohemia.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some day I will give you my history,” she told him.
But Van Zandt only laughed and asked, “Shall we go
to the play to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He cares no more for me than for the glass he is holding,”
Mrs. Harding now thinks, as she watches his face,
turned again toward the orchestra. “Don’t you ever
think of anything except music?” she demands, a little
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes; of a great many other things. For instance,
I was this minute thinking of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, indeed?” ironically. “Something vastly complimentary,
no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt smiles emphatically. “I was thinking that
I should like to set you to music, if I possessed the
faculty,” he says, as he glances humorously at his companion’s
pouting face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What should you write, a waltz refrain or a dancehall
ditty?” asks Mrs. Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither; I should write a symphony, a wild sort of
affair,” he smiles. “It would begin quietly and run along
for bars and bars in a theme that would suggest days
when the heart was young and life seemed a pathway of
roses. This would give place to scherzo and the whole
movement would be light and playful and singing. Then
the music would begin to grow troublous, anon turbulent,
and would finally burst into uncontrollable tumult.
This would gradually pass away, and the third movement
would be capriccio, the music now flashing fire, again
singing on like a mountain brook, on and on, and on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very discerning, Mr. Van Zandt,” says Isabel,
biting her lip. “What name should you bestow on this
remarkable symphony?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should call it ‘Isabel.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the last movement, what would that be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that would be unfinished, like Schubert’s,” Van
Zandt replies, with a provoking smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fortunately. For if you design to complete it you
will have to do so from memory. I am going away,”
declares Isabel, with a flush in each cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Going away? Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, mon ami, that is for you to find out. Besides,
what do you care? I have had an offer—diplomatic
service, I believe it is politely called. I leave in two
days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove! You would do well in diplomatic circles,”
exclaims Van Zandt, glancing at her in frank admiration.
“You said nothing of this before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have only just made up my mind. Your symphony
decided me,” Isabel avers with some bitterness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Garden is filling up,” Van Zandt remarks
abruptly. About all the tables around them are beginning
to be taken. “Hello! There’s that chap again,”
he adds, as two men seat themselves at an adjoining table
and fall to chatting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t know I was a musical critic, did you, Barker?
Well, you see our regular music expert is off duty sick
to-night, so they put me on the job. It’s a short one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your duties, friend Ashley, appear to be beautifully
diversified.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are that. Anything from a murder to a concert.
I suppose Raymond is about the same as when we left it,
about a year ago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To a dot. Same crowd on the hotel veranda. Same
symposium of hay, horse and village gossip.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just the same it is a great country. I’d give several
good iron dollars to be back for one morning in that
gorge near South Ashfield, on the old wood road where
I ran upon Ernest Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Push over a bit. Here’s another party,” says Barker,
as a jolly quartet approach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Plenty of room,” they declare, as they find chairs and
seat themselves close by. The man nearest to the detective
and the newspaper man is a stout, florid-faced
party, whose clean-cut visage and smooth bearing betoken
the sporting man. His companions are well-dressed
young men about town.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on, major,” remarks one of the latter, interrupting
the stout party in the act of giving an order to
the waiter. “I’ll buy this round, gentlemen, and we will
make it wine. I played in luck to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? Cards run well, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never saw them come easier. I had a bit of luck,
major, which does not materialize often enough to render
poker a continuously profitable employment. I sat between
two men who raised the pot four times before the
draw, and I filled up a straight flush.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You stood the raises on a bob flush?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had to. It was open at both ends. Basket of wine,
waiter, and fetch it in a hurry,” adds the young man,
whom his friends call Chauncey, and he gives the waiter
a tip that sends him a-flying.</p>

<p class='c011'>The major smiles as the reminiscences of innumerable
interesting jack-pots are stirred up by the story of his
young friend’s good luck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speaking of straight flushes,” he observes, “I never
saw a hand fill more neatly or appropriately than during
a little game in which I was sitting three or four years
ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Story by the major, gentlemen,” cries Chauncey, rapping
the table to order and receiving the angry glances
of a number of people about him who are trying to hear
the music. “Here comes the wine. We will drink a
toast to all straight flushes, high or low, and then the
major shall have the floor.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A SUPPOSITION BECOMES A FACT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You remember when Phil Clark was running up on
Fifth Avenue,” begins the major, after the wine has been
brought and pronounced only half-iced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather,” responds Chauncey, dryly. “I dropped five
hundred there one night and it wasn’t much of a game
at that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I drifted into Phil’s one night three years ago,
more or less, and found the place as quiet as a country
village. There was no big game going on, and mighty
few small ones. In one of the rooms I found Col.
Dunnett. You remember Dunnett. We were chatting
and commenting on the dullness of the evening, when
two young men came into the room and, after a glance
at us, one of them suggested a hand at poker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew one of the young men slightly. His name
was Stanley, I believe. Quiet, reserved sort of a chap.
He hadn’t been in New York long, he said. Made
books out at the Sheepshead races. I did not fancy his
friend, who had been drinking some and was inclined
to be a bit noisy. His name—let me see—Fenton, or
Fallon; no, Felton, that was what Stanley called him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We began the game and it broke up after the hand I
started in to tell you about. The betting simmered down
to Felton and Stanley. Felton held four aces and bet all
the cash he had. ‘I ought to raise you,’ said Stanley;
‘still,’ he added, ‘if that is all the cash you have—’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You needn’t worry about me,’ sneered Felton, as
he took a check-book from his pocket. ‘I said that was
all the change I had with me, but my check is good.’ He
scratched off a check and threw it on the table. ‘You can
see that, or call my previous bet, as you please.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stanley was as calm as I am now. He leaned over
to me, and, spreading his cards, asked: ‘Major, will you
loan me a thousand a moment to bet this hand?’ I
glanced at it and had a trifle of difficulty in restraining
my surprise. He had filled, as he told me afterward, the
middle of a straight flush, king up!</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Cert, my boy,’ I replied, cheerfully, to his request,
and I passed over two $500 bills. Stanley tossed them
on the table, and looked inquiringly at Felton. The
latter, with a smile of sublime confidence, spread
out four aces. ‘No good,’ was Stanley’s calm announcement.
He exhibited his hand, and then pocketing
the stakes, after returning me my thousand, he remarked:
‘Thank you, gentlemen, for your entertainment.
I don’t believe I’ll play any more to-night.’ And
putting on his coat and hat, he left the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Felton sat like one dazed for some moments. Then
he walked to the bar and after a stiff drink hurried off.
I never saw either of them after that night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley and Barker have been silent and interested
listeners to this yarn by the major. As the latter and his
friends rise Ashley rises also and taps the major on the
shoulder. “Pardon the intrusion,” he says, with an engaging
smile. “I have been vastly interested in your
poker story, sir, for the reason that I think I know one
of the players—Felton, I believe you called him. Do
you happen to recall what sort of a looking chap he was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hanged if I remember,” replies the major, wondering
at the other’s earnestness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was he a rather tall, good-looking young fellow,
with light-brown hair and eyes and a tawny mustache?”
persists Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that you speak of the mustache, I believe that
your description fits him. He had a heavy, yellowish
mustache, which he was in the habit of biting, as though
his dinner did not suit him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” says Ashley. “Will you have something
more to drink, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the major and his party take themselves off and
Ashley resumes his seat with a satisfied smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, Barker, we hit it about right after all, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would appear so,” returns the detective complacently.
“We now know what we have assumed to have
been the case—that Ernest Stanley suffered imprisonment
two years for another’s crime, and that the real criminal,
the man who forged Cyrus Felton’s name, was none
other than his son, Ralph Felton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Barker pronounces these words Ashley hears a
smothered exclamation behind him and turns quickly.
But all he sees is a gentleman and lady gathering their
wraps preparatory to taking their departure. The man’s
back is toward Ashley, but the latter waits until the party
faces his way and then for the space of a second their
eyes meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is only one more selection, and it does not
amount to much,” Van Zandt tells Mrs. Harding, and
they join the crowd that is leaving the garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know those two men who sat at the next
table to us? The younger looked at you as though he
knew you and was waiting to be recognized.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your imagination, cara mia. I know neither of
them,” replies Van Zandt, lightly. Then, as he hands her
into a carriage at the corner and says “Kensington” to
the driver, he holds Isabel’s hand a moment at parting
and inquires gravely: “So you are really going away
then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In two days,” she answers, and searches his face for
some evidence of regret. It is as impassive as the sphinx.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I suppose I shall see you at the French ball
to-morrow evening?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may, if you care to look for a Russian court
lady, attired wholly in black.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rest assured that the festivities will be robed in sables
until I find her. Good-night.” Van Zandt closes the
carriage door, watches it a moment as it rattles up the
avenue and then saunters toward Broadway.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley and Barker have remained at their table in the
garden and Jack is telling the detective that for the
second time within twenty-four hours he has caught the
stare of the man with the brown beard and piercing
eyes. “I have seen that face somewhere,” he mutters,
as he wrinkles his brow in a desperate effort to burst
the memory cell that prisons the secret. Suddenly he
smites the table a blow that sets the glasses jingling and
invites the disapprobation of the waiter. “Oh, memory!
Memory, thou sleepy, shiftless warder of the brain!” he
cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter now?” asks Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep calm, old chap,” returns Ashley, gripping the
detective’s wrist. “Keep calm while I confess to you that
we have let slip through our hands the key to the Hathaway
mystery!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What!” almost shouts the detective, starting to his
feet. “You mean—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean that the man with the brown beard and stiletto
optics who just left us is my friend of the mountain
gorge. He is Ernest Stanley!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, he has slipped us this time,” says the detective,
disconsolately, as they stand outside the garden and
sweep the street with anxious gaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet,” Ashley rejoins cheerfully. “See! There he
is beyond that third light, handing his magnificent companion
into a carriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Call a cab and follow them,” says the detective, starting
toward the line of conveyances pulled up at the curb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No need of that,” Ashley interrupts. “He is not going
to ride.” At that moment it was that Van Zandt closed
the door to the carriage which bore Mrs. Harding to
the Kensington, and as he starts toward Broadway the
detective and the newspaper man follow at a cautious
distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Unconscious of the espionage Van Zandt starts uptown
at a swinging gait. At Thirty-second Street he
branches into Sixth Avenue, and the two men behind
him wonder that he does not ride. At the park he turns
down Fifty-ninth Street and finally enters the Wyoming
apartment house, leaving Ashley and Barker staring up
at the brownstone elevation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The former waits five minutes and then pulls the bell.
“The name of the gentleman who has just gone upstairs?”
he asks the colored attendant who responds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Phillip Van Zandt,” replies the sable youth, as he
slips a half-dollar into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Van Zandt—is that his name?” queries Ashley, a
trifle disappointed, although he might have expected a
strange name. Then the porter tells him that the gentleman
with the brown beard has been a resident of the
Wyoming for several months; that he is a wealthy
bachelor, and a variety of other equally important information.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what do you think now?” asks Barker, as they
walk over to the elevated road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t changed my opinion,” is Ashley’s response.
“I believe that Phillip Van Zandt is or was Ernest
Stanley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we have him located, at any rate,” remarks the
detective. “See you at the French ball to-morrow night?
I am on the lookout for a couple of gentry whom I
expect to be there. This is my station. Good-night.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>“DON CAESAR DE BAZAN.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The big French ball, that annual revel at the metropolis,
brings together a motley assemblage of the devotees
of folly. The scene at the entrance to Madison Square
Garden to-night is the same scene witnessed at this
function the year preceding, and the year before that.
A mass of cabs and carriages in apparently inextricable
confusion fill the street. They struggle up and deposit
their fares and escorts and chaperons fight their way
through the mob that blocks the brilliantly lighted entrance,
and not always without an unpleasant encounter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Upon the threshold of the gay interior Louise Hathaway
pauses diffidently and thanks fortune that a mask
hides her face from the inquisitive stares around her.
But led by Jack Ashley, Louise and Mr. Felton proceed
to a box and once within its shelter the young girl gives
herself up to an unmixed enjoyment of the brilliant spectacle
before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scene is decorous, even sedate. Few acquaintances
have been made, and when the strains of “Loin du Bal”
arise in voluptuous swell only a small number of dancers
respond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why this is as proper as one of our country dances,
and far less noisy,” Louise whispers to Ashley, but that
knowing young man winks mysteriously behind his mask
and remarks: “Wait!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I shan’t wait,” is the young lady’s response.
“You remember what I emphatically declared—only an
hour or two and then we return to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you need fear nothing that would shock you
in the least degree,” Ashley assures her. “The rioting
does not begin until after midnight, and does not amount
to much then. But see. The floor is filling up, the
reserve is wearing off, and it would need only the
eruption of some reckless spirit to bring on a pandemonium.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is apparent that only a desire to humor the wishes
of Miss Hathaway has led Cyrus Felton to the garden.
And yet it is all so novel, all so bright and full of color,
that he becomes interested in spite of himself, and when
Ashley proposes a tour of the floor with a peep at the
wine-room, Mr. Felton glances irresolutely at Louise.
The young lady nods an assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not be gone long,” she enjoins, “although I could
listen to the music and watch the picture half the night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When they are gone she leans back in her chair, partly
draws the box draperies, and watches dreamily the ever-changing
panorama on the vast floor. Suddenly there is
borne to her ears a melody strangely sweet, yet filled with
a subtle melancholy. Louise catches her breath and
listens. It is the andante of the Beethoven Sonata Pathetique
she played so often in her old Raymond home.
It has always been her favorite, and she is really an artist
in soul and execution. Some one is whistling softly the
divine first theme, and with a tenderness she has often
felt yet could not satisfactorily express through the
medium of an unsympathetic pianoforte.</p>

<p class='c011'>She leans over the box and her eyes rest upon the
figure of a man attired in the costume of Don Caesar de
Bazan. He is leaning carelessly against the pillar of the
box in which she is sitting, not a dozen feet from her.
So closely does his costume fit him and so bravely does
he bear it that he looks a veritable Don Caesar who has
stepped for an hour from a bygone century. A brown
beard covers the lower part of his face; all above is
hidden by a black silk mask.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Louise is taking note of this interesting personality
she hears the door open behind her, and turns
expecting to greet Mr. Felton or Ashley. Instead a
stranger steps rather shakily into the box and closes the
door with an affable “Good-evening, mademoiselle.”
Louise makes no reply, and her unwelcome visitor drops
into a seat with easy familiarity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been more enthusiastically received to-night,
but I will let that pass,” he remarks, with cheerful impudence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know you, sir,” says Louise frigidly, as she
rises and casts a wildly anxious look over the ball-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, I am not so hard to get acquainted with,”
offers the insolent mask. “Will you drink a bottle of
wine with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave me at once!” commands Louise, pointing to
the door with trembling finger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By George! That’s an attitude worthy of Lady Macbeth,”
remarks his insolence, in frank admiration. “I
will go,” he adds, in mock humility, “but I must at least
have a kiss to solace me for the loss of your society.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would not dare!” gasps Louise, retreating to the
box rail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dare?” laughs his insolence; “I would dare anything
for such a prize,” and he approaches her unsteadily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Louise’s frightened gaze is turned toward the ball-room
and again rests upon Don Caesar de Bazan, who,
attracted by the colloquy, has stepped a pace out upon
the floor and is an interested spectator of the encounter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Save me!” she whispers, and sinks upon one knee.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the entreaty is superfluous. Already Don
Caesar’s hands are on the rail and with a vault he is in
the box. His arm shoots out and his insolence goes
down with a crash. He struggles to his feet with an oath
and makes for Don Caesar; but the latter’s threatening
attitude, clenched fist and eyes that flash fire through
the black mask, cause him to stop, and muttering, “You
will hear from me again,” he leaves the box.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Caesar lifts his cap and is about to follow, when
Louise interrupts him. “Do not go,” she says gratefully,
“until I have thanked you a thousand times for the
service you have rendered me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Caesar bows. “As for the service,” he remarks
lightly, “it was nothing. The fellow has been drinking,
and seeing you alone—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My friends have left me only for a few moments,”
Louise hastens to explain, as she glances over the floor
and bites her lips in vexation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I may remain until they return?” Don Caesar
observes inquiringly, dropping into a chair. “Some other
graceless scamp may blunder in here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Louise’s eyes express a timid assent to the proposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the first of these balls that you have attended?”
asks Don Caesar, noting that she is ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; and it will be the last. I had read much of them,
how brilliant they were, and all that, and I naturally
acquiesced when I was tempted with an invitation. For
I was told that if one went masked there was no harm
in looking on for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor is there. The wickedness will not begin for
some time, and it is at best, or worst, a cheap, tawdry
wickedness, wholly unattractive to saint or sinner. It is
all inexpressibly stupid. A lot of tinsel-decked people
rushing hither and thither in the dance, with little regard
for the rhythm of the music and less for the etiquette of
the ball-room, and a line of weary clubmen, bankers,
men-about-town, butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers
looking on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you attend, though your remark indicates familiarity
with the function.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I attend. For in spite of it all there are
flowers and music, light and color and a certain brilliancy
that enables one to forget for the nonce the even deadlier
stupidity of the outside world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Caesar de Bazan of old was not a cynic,” remarks
Louise, smilingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had he been he would not have maintained our evergreen
regard. When we sit down to a book or a play
we like to leave our cynicism behind us; to live with men
who have not a care beyond the morrow; men who
mount horse and ride away from their troubles; whose
swords leap from their sheaths at the breath of an insult;
good, hearty, whole-souled fellows whose fortunes one
delights to follow, but whom, alas, we seldom meet in
the flesh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps it is as well. You might grow awfully tired
of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps. I sometimes think that, outside of the lasting
friendships with the people in books and plays, the
only satisfactory acquaintances are the chance ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” murmurs Louise, dreamily. She wonders
whether the face behind the black mask matches the
melody of the voice. A similar thought flits through
Don Caesar’s mind, as his eyes take in the graceful figure
of the girl, clad all in black, a single ornament fastened
at the long white throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, too, have few friends,” says Louise. “But there
is one friend who never fails me, through joy or sadness—my
music.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, there is naught like it to drive away that enemy
to life, dull care,” put in the Don. “It is my one passion.
And I have cultivated it only lately. But now I give
myself up to it entirely, attending every concert of any
repute, and bewailing fate a thousand times that I cannot
play, or sing, or write.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I can guess your favorite melody—one of
them, at least.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you, indeed?” asked Don Caesar, in interested
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Sonata Pathetique.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, is it not beautiful? You have guessed correctly,
but how?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You were whistling it softly as you stood near yonder
pillar, a moment before the occasion for your presence
here arose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very probably. It is continually running through
my head. Do you know, the melody has two meanings
to me. When I am out of patience with the world and
myself it seems tinged with an inexpressible melancholy.
And when I am in good spirits the refrain becomes singing,
joyous, triumphant. Has it ever seemed so to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know. It has always seemed beautiful. It is
my favorite.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And mine. You are not a New Yorker,” ventures
Don Caesar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? It is now my turn, Don Caesar, to marvel at
your guessing powers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Caesar laughs softly. “It does not demand an
extraordinary acute discernment. Your accent and manner
betoken the New Englander.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are we then so provincial that we so easily betray ourselves?
But you are right. I am a Vermonter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought so. Odd, is it not, how dominos conduce
to confidences, even among strangers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. And yet I think they would prove unsatisfactory
for conversational purposes among people who—”
Louise pauses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“People who have been formally introduced, eh?” finishes
Don Caesar. “Are you in the city for any length
of time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only until Saturday. We sail for Cuba then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cuba? That is a long way off,” muses Don Caesar.
“I came very near forgetting that I had not been formally
introduced and expressing the regret that I should not
see you again before you sail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You said a moment ago that the only satisfactory
acquaintances were the transitory ones,” Louise reminds
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True. But that rule has its exceptions, like all
others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Consistency is no more a man’s attribute than a
woman’s,” moralizes Miss Hathaway. “My friends approach,
Don Caesar,” she adds, as she catches a glimpse
of Mr. Felton and Ashley threading their way over the
crowded floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the signal for my departure, then,” says Don
Caesar. “Before I go I would crave one small boon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I owe you some return for your timely assistance.
Speak, Don Caesar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just a glimpse of the face that your mask so jealously
veils.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” cries Louise, somewhat disturbed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember,” urges Don Caesar, “we shall never meet
again—But ’twould be ungenerous to press my request,”
he adds, rising. “I must say farewell, then, with
only the memory of a sweet voice to recall one of the few
pleasant quarter-hours that I have known.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Some impulse, she can hardly explain what, seizes
Louise. With trembling fingers she detaches her mask
and uncovers a face suffused with blushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought so!” murmurs Don Caesar, as his eyes take
in the glory of that face, which is almost immediately
veiled again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” he says, simply, and presses to his lips
for an instant the hand she timidly gives him in parting.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is gone, and Louise sinks back into her chair with
beating heart, wondering whether she has been foolish,
or unmaidenly, or indiscreet. She forgets to administer
to Ashley the scolding he deserves for his long absence
and receives abstractedly his explanation of a row in the
wine-room and their detention by the crowd. Her gaze
wanders about the ball-room in search of the graceful
figure of Don Caesar de Bazan, but he has vanished.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A FAIRY TALE THAT CAME TRUE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Toward 10 o’clock Louise Hathaway decides that she
has witnessed enough of the brilliant panorama to warrant
her in returning to the hotel, and as Cyrus Felton is
plainly bored by a scene not attuned to his temperament,
Ashley hunts up their wraps, hails a carriage and they
are driven to the St. James.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will make a night of it, I suppose,” Miss Hathaway
remarks, as Ashley prepares to say good-night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I shall remain only long enough to finish my
story for the paper. I wrote the introduction this afternoon.
One year’s ball is much the same as another’s.
Have you any plans for the morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None, except mild sight-seeing. Will you not lunch
with us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be delighted,” murmurs Ashley. To be near
Miss Hathaway is pleasure unalloyed; incidentally he desires
an opportunity to quietly study Cyrus Felton. “At
1 o’clock, say?” he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At 1 o’clock. We must thank you again, Mr. Ashley,
for your escort this evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t mention it—again,” smiles Ashley. “I am sorry
I cannot ask you to assist in my work to-morrow. It
would be fully as interesting and more to your taste,
likely, than the French ball.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it cannot be a political meeting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly. It is the trial trip of the new United States
cruiser America, probably the fastest vessel of any size
afloat in the world to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be delightful. You must tell me all about it
when you return. Your description will be much more
interesting, I am sure, than the newspaper accounts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fully as interesting as the Hemisphere’s story, perhaps.
Good-night, Miss Hathaway. Oh, by the way,
Mr. Felton,” as Louise trips upstairs, “did you know that
Roger Hathaway’s revolver has been found?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley asks the question in the most casual of tones,
but his keen eyes are riveted on the elder man’s face.
The result is not wholly what the questioner expected.
Mr. Felton simply stares at Ashley and repeats: “Hathaway’s
revolver found? Where? When?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was fished out of Wild River about opposite the
cemetery a day or two ago. But perhaps it was after you
had started for New York. Odd, is it not, that the
weapon with which the crime was perhaps committed
should be brought to light within a stone’s throw of the
grave of the murdered man? But pardon me. Perhaps,
I have awakened painful reflections; so I will say no more.
Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton stands like a stone upon the threshold
to the reading-room for fully a minute after Ashley has
left the hotel. Then he turns and goes slowly upstairs to
his room.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Ashley reaches the Garden he hunts up Barker
and rescues that amiable gentleman from the importunities
of a brace of masks who are gayly informing him that
they are “just beginning to like him.” Ashley drags him
away and asks: “Have you located the gentry for whom
you were looking to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but I have chanced upon one or two choice incidents
in society life which the chief may find useful
some day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. Let me in early when they materialize. Now,
old chap, if you will kill time here for half an hour or so,
until I finish my story, I’ll join you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley hunts up an out-of-the-way corner and the
work is soon finished and dispatched by a district messenger
boy. Then the newspaper man returns to the
wine-room, but Barker has strayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>While Jack is lounging about the edges of the ball-room,
his cheek is brushed by a Jack rose tossed from a
near-by box. He looks around and sees leaning over the
box rail a woman attired in the costume of a lady of the
Russian court. The eyes behind the mask twinkle invitingly,
and as she is alone Ashley fastens the rose in
his coat, tosses a kiss to the donor and proceeds to look
for the door leading to that particular box.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I enter, lady fair?” he asks, as he stands upon the
threshold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On one condition,” the lady in black informs him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Name it,” he smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That you do not ask me to drink a bottle of wine
with you; that you talk of something interesting; and
that you do not make love to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you call that one condition? But I accept,”
says Ashley, closing the door behind him. The next instant
he suppresses an exclamation and a tendency
toward mild protestation. For in closing the door he has
caught one finger on a nail which some careless carpenter
omitted to drive home, and the digit gets a painful
tear.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady in black extends sympathy and lends her own
dainty lace handkerchief to bind up his wound. As he
bends to tie the knot with his teeth the perfume on the
lace almost startles him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your first condition, madam, was easily accepted,” he
smiles, as he throws himself into a chair and toys with
the handkerchief about his finger. “The second is more
difficult to live up to, and the third is cruel.” He is
carelessly unwrapping the handkerchief as though to rebind
it, and is looking for some initial.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, tell me a story—something I haven’t heard,”
yawns the lady in black. “At the first sign of stupidity I
shall send you away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A story?” drawls Ashley. Ah, he has found what he
sought. In one corner of the handkerchief is the letter
“I,” curiously embroidered in silk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” he says, in rare good humor, “I promise
you a story that, while it may not be entirely new to you,
will hold your interest to the end. But first, madam, I
must beg of you to lay aside your domino, that I may
know whether my tale is interesting you or I am courting
the unhappy fate which you threatened should be meted
out to stupidity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady in black laughs musically and, partially drawing
the box draperies, she tosses off her mask, and, to
Ashley’s intense amaze, reveals the face of the handsome
woman whom he remembers to have seen with Phillip
Van Zandt the preceding night at the Damrosch concert.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Jack Ashley is not a young man who permits his
face or voice to betray his emotions. So he knots the
lace once more about his injured digit, settles himself
comfortably in his chair and begins:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Once upon a time—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is this a fairy tale?” interrupts his handsome auditor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A fairy tale? Perhaps. But a fairy tale that came
true. Once upon a time there lived in a small New
England community a youth to whom the simple amusements
and rustic pleasures of his native town became as
tedious as a twice-told tale. As his father was engaged
in a business whose interests extended over the country,
the youth was given a roving commission, and soon after
he was tasting the sweets of an existence in the great
city. Metropolitan life suited him to a T. His only regret
was that his means were not sufficient to keep pace
with his luxurious tastes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the course of time he met and loved a very pretty
girl. She had hair of midnight, eyes like black diamonds,
a superb figure and a thousand charms. Whether her
heart was as true as her face was fair, I know not. The
torrent which bore these two hearts was more or less
turbulent. In the trouble which came between them I
am charitable enough to believe that the man was to
blame. The youth found that living beyond his means
has an inevitable and unpleasant result, and it was not
long ere his father, after palliating innumerable offenses,
summoned him home. He was given a position in a
bank in the town which he still despised, and he soon
forgot his city love, being assisted in this forgetfulness
by a passion which he had conceived for the beautiful
daughter of the cashier of the bank in which he was
employed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The neglected one wrote many letters, but could obtain
no satisfaction of her faithless swain. Finally she
decided to visit him in his New England home; so on a
memorable afternoon she arrived in his town, went to a
hotel and sent word to the youth that she desired to see
him at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” demands the lady in black, as Ashley pauses.
The flash in her eyes and the nervous fingers tell him
that, while his story may not be enjoyed, it is being
listened to with intense interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The youth obeyed the summons,” he resumes, “and
there was a scene. Money was demanded, and money he
had none. But perhaps it was to be had somewhere.
That night a murder was committed in the town. It was
an extremely mysterious affair, and the excitement which
it caused was intensified a day or two later, when the
young man of our story suddenly disappeared and was
never after heard from. The detective employed on the
case assumed that if he could find the mysterious woman
who registered at the hotel the day of the tragedy some
light might be thrown upon the affair and the whereabouts
of the absent young man ascertained.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you any object in telling me this story?” asks
the lady in black, in a voice which she strives to render
calm and unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only your entertainment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you have not succeeded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have succeeded in one thing,” returns Ashley, in
quiet triumph. “I have found the woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? That is more interesting. But perhaps you
are mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible. The beautiful unknown left in the hotel
room a lace handkerchief scented with a most peculiar
perfume.” Ashley is slowly unwrapping the lace creation
about his finger, and he sniffs it as he speaks. “A perfume
which the finder of the handkerchief had never
known before,” he goes on, as he spreads the lace upon
his knee. “Besides the perfume, which distinguished this
from thousands of other handkerchiefs, there was in one
corner the letter ‘I,’ curiously embroidered in silk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As if he were alone and talking to himself, Ashley
takes from a wallet in his pocket the handkerchief which
for months he had carefully treasured, and spreading it
upon his knee compares it with the one which lately
wrapped his finger. They are identical. Then he looks
up and catches the half-scornful, half-startled gaze of the
lady in black.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that all?” she inquires.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. But I expect you to furnish the last chapter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady in black again adjusts her mask. “Not to-night,”
she says. “Come to my hotel to-morrow and I
will endeavor to gratify your curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whom shall I inquire for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you have my name.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes. And the hotel, madam?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Kensington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the hour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ten in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. I will be prompt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley leaves the box humming a lively air and proceeds
to look up his friend Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Busy, old man?” he asks, when he has finally located
the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not especially? Why?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you see that woman in black in yonder box, talking
with a swarthy-looking gentleman?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is ‘Isabel Winthrop.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The devil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but perhaps one of his satanic highness’ amiable
representatives. I have an interview arranged with her
for to-morrow at 10; place the Kensington. I want you
to follow her when she leaves the Garden and keep an
eye on her until 10 o’clock to-morrow morning. If I do
not hear from you before that hour I shall consider that
she has made the engagement in good faith. I have a big
day’s work to-morrow, and I believe I will go home and
turn in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, Jack, my boy. I will keep her ladyship in
view if she leads me to China. So long.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'>“Don’t be absurd, Don Manada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Absurd? Dios! I was never more thoroughly in
earnest in my life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nevertheless, you are absurd,” Isabel Harding smiles
tantalizingly over her champagne glass at the flushed
face and glistening eyes of her companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>This conversation occurs shortly after midnight at an
out-of-the-way table in the arcade at the east end of the
Garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>For all it began so decorously, this year’s ball is a particularly
riotous affair and already the fantastic orgee is
well under way. Masks have been scattered to the patchouli-laden
winds. Yet there are a few discreet folks
who, though they mingle with the mad crowd, have retained
their masks. As Don Manada and his companion
are comparatively removed from observation, they have
laid aside their dominos for the moment and are conversing
in earnest whispers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel Harding is so radiantly, magnificently, dangerously
beautiful that it is a terrific strain for the gentleman
at her side to maintain the least semblance of composure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what does my absurdity consist?” he demands in a
passionate whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you ask? You tell me that you love me—which
I already know—and urge a suit which I have twice
before told you is hopeless. You profess to believe that I
could learn in time to honestly return your undoubtedly
sincere affection. It is impossible. I will be honest with
you. I am not one to whom love comes slowly. I love
only one man, and he—don’t look so murderous, Don
Manada—he cares nothing for me,” she finishes, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, a truce to lovemaking!” rallies Isabel. “Don’t
look so fiercely downcast, Don Manada. Fill up the
glasses and we will drink a melancholy toast to unrequited
love. We are alike unsuccessful lovers. But we
will continue to be good friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible,” replies Don Manada, as he gloomily
pours out the wine. “I go to Cuba to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? I trust that I am not responsible for the
loss of your society to your New York friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, senora. I go because duty calls me, but I had
expected to wear a lighter heart than that which will
accompany me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Manada is too much occupied with his despair to
note the peculiar look which Isabel darts at him from
between her half-dropped eyelids.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cuba?” she repeats, dreamily. “Ah, I should like to
visit that country some day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Manada looks up with swift hope. “You would,
senora? Then you shall!” he cries. “We will leave to-morrow
on my vessel. I will be your slave. You have
but to speak and every wish will be gratified. You will
do me this favor,” he urges, and then, with the fervor and
descriptive powers of a Claude Melnotte, he proceeds to
paint a fascinating picture with a tropical background,
his enthusiasm fired by ravishing glances from his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite an escapade you have outlined,” smiled Isabel.
“But it is too prosy. If the voyage promised a dash of
adventure, if it were spiced with an element of danger,
I—” she pauses and lifts the wineglass slowly to her
lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Danger?” echoes Don Manada, with a curious smile.
“Dios! The voyage might not be without all the adventure
your heart could desire, senora.” He takes from
his pocket a newspaper clipping and hands it to Isabel,
after a glance about him to make certain that they are
unobserved. The clipping is from the current edition of
the Hemisphere. It is a dispatch from Key West, and a
portion of it reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“This city has been in a fever of excitement all day
over the report that an important filibustering expedition
is to leave New York this week to aid the Cuban
insurgents. The report is backed by excellent authority,
and there is no doubt that an effort will be made to send
valuable assistance to the patriots of the Antilles some
time during the week. In some way the United States
authorities and the Spanish government have got wind
of the proposed expedition and they are striving to nip
it in the bud. The Spanish warship Infanta Isabel this
morning steamed from this harbor for the purpose, one
of her officers said, of intercepting the filibusters on the
high seas.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It is also stated that a prominent and gallant member
of the Cuban revolutionary society will head the expedition,
but his identity has not been disclosed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Harding glances through the clipping and hands
it back with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you are the prominent and gallant member of
the Cuban revolutionary society referred to?” she infers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so loud!” cautions Don Manada. “We may be
overheard. What think you of the voyage now,
senora?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear it is a bit too dangerous,” replies Isabel, with a
yawn. “We should never reach Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trust me,” assents Don Manada, complacently.
“Once on the high seas, the Isabel will lead the Spanish
warships a pretty chase.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, the name of your schooner is the Isabel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of our yacht—yes. Is it not happily named?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps so,” answers Mrs. Harding, with an enigmatic
expression in her lustrous eyes. “And where
should I find your yacht in case I should at the last
moment decide to accept your offer of a merry voyage to
the tropics?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My yacht? I should conduct you to it,” says Don
Manada in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no; that would not do,” objects Isabel. “I should
be driven to it veiled just preceding its departure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Manada looks around the arcade, but there is
no one within twenty feet of their table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“North river, foot of 23d street,” he whispers. “You
will go?” as Isabel appears to be hesitating mid conflicting
emotions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will promise not to make love to me during the
entire voyage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will promise anything, senora, though you have
imposed an unhappy obligation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I think I will say—yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bueno!” cries the delighted Don Manada, and, seizing
Isabel’s hand, he covers it with passionate kisses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, by the way, what time do you sail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At 5 o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well. I will send final word to your hotel in
the morning. Now, leave me to dream over my folly,”
says Mrs. Harding, disengaging the hand which Don
Manada still tenderly holds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as the latter goes off to the wine-room to submerge
his happiness in champagne, Isabel leans back in
her chair and laughs softly. “The fool,” she sneers.
“Well, all men are fools—all but one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that one?” inquires a voice behind her. She
looks up startled, to meet the calm gaze of a man of perhaps
50, with dark hair and mustache slightly tinged with
gray and the distinct air of a soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, who but yourself?” returns Isabel composedly.
“Sit down, Gen. Murillo. I have much to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The intelligence is plainly of a pleasing nature. Gen.
Murillo murmurs “Bueno!” more than once as he listens,
and when she finishes he remarks approvingly: “You
have done well and may count on my gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracias,” responds Isabel. “That is about the extent
of my Spanish, General.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but you will learn readily. It is simple. Hist! a
gentleman approaches. It were well if we be seen little
together to-night. Until the morrow then, adios.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gen. Murillo moves off toward the swirl of dancers
and Isabel surveys with an air of recognition a gentleman
in the costume of Don Caesar de Bazan, who has descended
to the arcade by the north stairway and is
coming slowly toward her. Don Caesar looks curiously
after the departing form of the Spaniard; then, dropping
into a chair beside Isabel, he tosses off his mask and asks
carelessly: “Well, my dear Isabel, when do you leave
for Cuba?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Cuba?” repeats Mrs. Harding in simulated surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. After a glance at the gentleman who just
left you I do not need to be enlightened as to the diplomatic
duties to which you alluded last night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Phillip, I have few secrets that you do not
share,” Isabel says sweetly; “I leave for Cuba to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So soon,” he murmurs courteously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sooner the better. Every day I am near you
makes eventual separation the harder. I know that you
care nothing for me,” she goes on, her cheeks flushed
crimson. “Don’t interrupt me,” as Van Zandt seeks to
interpose a protest. “I know that you care nothing for
me, not in the way I would have you feel. I have your
friendship, yes, beyond that I am nothing to you. And
I—I love you, Phillip—love you as I never expected to
love a man. I make the avowal without shame, for I
know there is no possibility of a change in your sentiments
toward me. And I am going away—to-morrow,”
half sobs the woman, as she covers her face with her
hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt lays his hand upon Isabel’s head and
smooths the dark tresses sympathetically. She pushes
the hand away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Courage! Tears ill become a diplomat,” declares Van
Zandt. “This is a dreary world. We seldom attain our
heart’s desire, even though the object we seek be a lowly
one. Will you have some wine?” Isabel shakes her head.
She has dried her eyes and has relapsed into an apathetic
melancholy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt signals to a waiter. “A little wine will help
lighten our hearts,” he tells Mrs. Harding; “for believe
me, mine is not less heavy than yours. Cheer up and we
will drink a toast to all unrequited love.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel gives him a swift look of surprise. “You
heard?” she demands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard nothing,” he replies, smilingly. “What has
given rise to your question?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis less than an hour since I offered that very toast.
I have had a proposal to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? And you rejected it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you ask such a question. The world is full of
Don Manadas, but there is only one—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? The swarthy gentleman, with the curious white
mustachios?” interrupts Van Zandt. “I noticed you talking
with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had rejected him twice before, but his persistence is
worthy of a better cause. To-night I promised to accompany
him on a filibustering expedition to Cuba.
Think of it! The fool!” sneers Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you will not go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most certainly not. I only half-promised. To-morrow
I shall send word that I have changed my mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And meanwhile you have accomplished something
toward your new duties, eh?” remarks Van Zandt. If
Isabel Harding could read the dark, handsome face that
she loves so well, she would know that she has lost forever
the esteem of Phillip Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have betrayed the man who trusted you,” continues
Van Zandt in the same quiet and impassive voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Betrayed him? And what if I did?” flashes Isabel
passionately. “Call it treachery if you will. I say it is
only a reprisal of treachery. Take me out of here, Phillip.
I am sick of these lights and the music and the scent of
the flowers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will see you to a carriage,” says Van Zandt, quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten minutes later he says good-by to her, as he prepares
to close the carriage door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some day, Phillip, you will realize how much I love
you,” Isabel whispers, as she presses to her lips the hand
he mechanically gives her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Words, words, words; but destined to have a tragic
fulfillment!</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt looks after the retreating carriage with a
darkening brow. “Call it treachery if you will,” he repeats,
grimly. “By George! I’ll spike her ladyship’s
guns! The cause of liberty shall not be jeopardized by
the indiscretion of its friends or the machinations of its
enemies!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he turns and re-enters the garden a man steps to a
waiting cab, and, indicating the carriage which is bearing
off Isabel Harding, he whispers to his driver: “Keep
that rig in view till it stops. Understand?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>FOR THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You proposed to a lady to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that to you, sir?” Don Manada turns fiercely
upon the gentleman who has tapped him upon the
shoulder and requested the pleasure of a few moments’
conversation with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing to me, perhaps,” returns Phillip Van Zandt,
quietly; “to you much, possibly. Sit down. Or better,
suppose we adjourn to the arcade. We shall be freer
from interruption there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must decline to accompany you, sir, until I have
reason to believe that the matter on which you desire to
talk is of more importance than your opening remark
would indicate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt surveys the Cuban with a trifle of impatience.
“As you please,” he observes. “But permit me
to say that upon your disposition to listen to what I
have to impart depends the success or failure of the expedition
which is to start for Cuba to-morrow—or, rather,
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada starts violently and bends a searching look
upon the other’s face. “Nothing could be of greater importance
to me, sir,” he says, and without further remark
he follows Van Zandt to the little table where an hour ago
he for the third time offered Isabel Harding his hand and
heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, to business,” remarks Van Zandt, glancing at
his watch. “It is 1:30. Thirty minutes for talk, the rest
of the night for action. You are Don Manada of the
Cuban revolutionary society.” That gentleman bows.
“I am Phillip Van Zandt. That is all you need know
concerning myself. Mrs. Isabel Harding, the lady to
whom you made violent love to-night”—the Cuban
scowls, but Van Zandt goes on relentlessly—“I have
known for some months. She has honored me—shall I
say?—with her deep regard. Perhaps she hinted as
much to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada leans back in his chair and looks his new
acquaintance over critically. This, then, was his rival; a
negative one, to be sure, but a rival that any man might
fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it will flatter your vanity to know that the lady
in question confessed to me that she loved only one man
in the world and that that happy individual was not
myself, you are welcome to the information,” Manada
offers, sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. But I was already aware of the fact, and
it is not to the point. You proposed to Mrs. Harding and
were rejected. Stay,” as the other colors and is about
to make an angry retort: “I did not bring you here, sir,
to refresh your mind one instance in which the usually
discriminating Isabel displayed poor taste. But I repeat,
she rejected you; hence subsequently something must
have occurred between you to lead up to a rather peculiar
agreement—Mrs. Harding’s consent to accompany you
on a filibustering expedition?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Caramba! She told you—you overheard—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I overheard nothing. Eavesdropping is not in my
line. And she told me little more; but enough to warrant
me in stating that you have been indiscreet, sir, to use
no harsher term, and have jeopardized not only your own
welfare but that of your fellow-countrymen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seem to be pretty familiar with my affairs, senor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so familiar with them as the Spanish government
and the United States authorities may be,” responds Van
Zandt, dryly. “All I know of your plans I have told you.
What I do not know you will tell me now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An angry rejoinder trembles on Manada’s lips, but
something in the stern, quiet air of the man before him
checks his wrath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Harding,” resumes Van Zandt, “consented to
go to Cuba with you, did she not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Practically, yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you were to receive her final decision on the
morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, senor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She will not go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you persuaded her—you interfered,” cries Manada
hotly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did nothing of the sort. Still, I repeat, she will not
go. But, stay, perhaps she will,” murmurs Van Zandt,
thoughtfully. “Perhaps her ladyship’s plans lie deeper
than I have supposed,” he thinks. “But even if she does
go, I tell you, my friend, it were far better that you
burned your vessel where it now lies than that Isabel
Harding sets foot upon its deck.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your meaning?” demands Manada in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your face tells me that you have guessed the truth,”
Van Zandt says more kindly. “The woman has betrayed
you. She is a spy—diplomat is the polite word—in the
employ of the Spanish government.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Caramba!” hisses Manada, sinking back into his chair
with colorless cheeks. “But you can furnish proof of
what you assert?” he cries almost eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt’s lip curls. “Had you watched the fair
Isabel after you left her you would have seen join her a
gentleman whose presence in itself would have been
proof sufficient—Gen. Murillo. You know him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of the Spanish service,” murmurs Manada in crushed
tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely. I met him at the club the other day. And
if I mistake not he has done an excellent bit of work for
his government to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I will find the woman,” bursts out Manada, leaping
to his feet. “Por Dios! I will search her out and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will do nothing of the kind,” interrupts Van
Zandt, drawing the excited man back into his chair.
“Mrs. Harding left for her hotel half an hour ago. Even
were she here it would avail you nothing to confront her
with her—diplomacy. Gen. Murillo is already in possession
of your plans. No, my friend; the mischief is
done, but happily it is not irremediable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” cries Manada, with a flash of hope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, listen to me. We have wasted too much time
already. What is the name of your vessel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Isabel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? Pretty name, but have it changed at the first
opportunity. Where does she now lie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“North River, foot of Twenty-third Street.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excellent,” comments Van Zandt, his eyes lighting
with satisfaction. “And at what time did you intend to
sail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At five in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are of course aware that both the Spanish and
United States governments are on the keen lookout for
filibustering craft?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly,” Manada replies, grimly. “But we were
confident of slipping through unmolested. We had arranged
to clear for the Bermudas, and once on the high
seas we felt sure of running away from any warships that
might lie in our course.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, your vessel is a yacht. And the cargo—of what
does that consist?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two thousand rifles and 200,000 rounds of cartridges.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is it loaded?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The ammunition is packed in kegs, ostensibly containing
salt fish; the rifles are in bags and are hidden at the
bottom of bins of potatoes in the hold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cargo could be shifted before daybreak, do you
think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two or three hours should suffice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. You must have noticed, lying in the neighborhood
of your vessel, a rather trim article in the yacht
line.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Semiramis? Yes. A magnificent vessel!” exclaims
Manada.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt nods. “She is my property and I believe
her to be the fastest vessel afloat in the world to-day.
Now here is my plan—I consider it the only one that will
extricate you from the dilemma in which you are placed:
I will place the Semiramis at the service of the struggling
patriots of the Antilles. We will shift the Isabel’s cargo
before the night is gone, and before the sun goes down
on another day the Semiramis will be on her way to
Cuba. Once without New York bay I defy anything
short of a cannon ball to overhaul her. What say you,
Don Manada?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cuban’s face expresses the astonishment and joy
that he feels. To be raised suddenly from the depths of
despair to the pinnacle of hope effects a remarkable
change in one of his temperament.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Santa Maria!” he cries, as he presses warmly Van
Zandt’s hands. “You have done me as great a service
as one man can do another. Por Dios! We shall outwit
them cleverly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then let us be off,” says Van Zandt. “It is after 2
o’clock and we have little time to spare.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The men secure their coats and hats and ten minutes
later board a cross-town car.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senor Van Zandt, I owe you a debt of gratitude,” declares
Manada; “yet I find myself marveling that you, a
stranger, and the one man to win Isabel Harding’s affection,
should interest yourself in me and the cause I represent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it promised an adventure; something I have long
been in need of to stir my blood to action,” replies Van
Zandt, lightly. “Besides, am I not an American, and is not
the cause of liberty a cause that appeals to every American
with a spark of manhood in his soul? Only those
who know what liberty is realize its priceless worth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They are now walking along West Street. Manada
silently reproaching himself with his recent folly, wraps
his greatcoat more tightly about him, and breathes a
shivering malediction on the cutting winds that sweep
adown the Hudson.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sky is overcast and a slight snow is falling. It is
a good night for the work in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The river front is black and silent and the outlines of
the vessels about the pier are barely distinguishable
through the driving storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>West Street, though dimly lighted, is not deserted.
From the grog-shops come echoes of many a brawl, and
every now and then a drunken longshoreman reels or is
thrown into the street and staggers off, heaven knows
where. Every half-hour or so a ferry boat lumbers in and
out of the slip, and there is a temporary bustle in the
vicinage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A miserable night, senor,” remarks Van Zandt, as
they cross West Street and pick their way toward the
pier where lies the vessel in which are centered now all
of Don Manada’s hopes. The latter has forgotten for
the nonce his recent humiliation and is keenly alive to
the adventurous undertaking in hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The men plunge through the gloom, muffled to the
eyes and with heads bent before the biting blasts from
the river, when their ears are suddenly assailed by the
sound of a scuffle ahead of them and a half-choked cry
for help. Quickening their steps, they run upon two
men. One of them is prone upon the pier; the other,
clearly his assailant, bends over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the scamp can rise Van Zandt deals him a blow
with his heavy cane that stretches him beside his victim.
He is not a courageous rogue, or if he is realizes that his
chance for an argument is not especially good. So when
he struggles to his feet he makes off without a word,
without even an imprecation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt and Manada raise the prostrate form and
bear it back to the street. As the lamplight falls upon the
face of the unconscious man Van Zandt utters an ejaculation
of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By heaven! it is Gen. Murillo! You see, my friend,
that I was not mistaken. He probably came down here
to have a look at the Isabel, and was set upon by one of
the scum of the river front.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada nods a silent assent. “He must not see us,”
he mutters, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be alarmed. He is not likely to recognize any
one for a few minutes. I hope he is not badly hurt. Off
with him to yonder saloon; or, better, to the ferryhouse.
The man will be safer there, though we are more likely to
find a policeman at the saloon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A policeman is at the ferryhouse, however, and assistance
is summoned. Van Zandt and Manada wait until
Gen. Murillo is laid in the ambulance and the surgeon
in charge has assured them that the man is not fatally
hurt; then they tell their story to the policeman and go
about their business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A peculiar episode,” remarks Van Zandt. “Our friend
will never know to whom he owes his rescue and perhaps
his life. Our affair must be hurried, nevertheless, for we
know what his first effort will be when he recovers consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet some day, when Cuba is free, I shall have the
pleasure of recalling the incident to his mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When Cuba is free,” repeats Van Zandt. “Well, luck
favoring us, we shall fire a shot to-day that will ring
in the ears of the government at Madrid. Here we are
at the Semiramis. Where is the Isabel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just beyond. Not twenty feet away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt hails his yacht and ten minutes later he and
Manada are in the luxurious cabin, in consultation with
Capt. Beals, a bluff old Maine sea dog, who is prepared
for any caprice on the part of his employer and expresses
not the least surprise when informed that arrangements
for a cruise to Cuba must be instantly set afoot.</p>

<p class='c011'>And that morning, while the wind howls around Manhattan
Island, and drives the sleet into the eyes of belated
pedestrians; while Murillo awakens to consciousness in
Bellevue Hospital and tells the attending surgeon that,
head or no head, he leaves for Cuba within half a dozen
hours; and while the last carriage load of half-drunken
sports dashes away from the Madison Square Garden, a
work is in progress aboard the Semiramis that means
more to its owner than he dreams of as he stands with
folded arms in the dim light of the ship lanterns, watching
silently the transshipment of the insurgent’s arms.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>TWO KINDS OF BLOCKADE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>About 9:30 of the morning following the French ball
Phillip Van Zandt drops into his favorite seat in the
dining-room of the St. James hotel and picks up the
morning paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely had he unfolded it when his attention was
attracted by two persons seated at the table beyond him.
They are Cyrus Felton and Louise Hathaway, and the
latter never looked fairer than on this bright March
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, my divinity of the ball,” he murmurs. “By Eros!
She is superb. Hair, a mass of gold and the sunlight
gives it just the right effect. Purity and innocence are in
those blue eyes and in every line of the face. Knowing
no evil and fearing none, and yet with the self-poise of a
queen. It almost restores one’s confidence in humanity
to look upon such a face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would be glad indeed to know her, but the opportunity
for an introduction is not likely to arise. I could
scarcely presume on last night’s meeting, and besides,
she would hold me to my word. What impulse possessed
her to remove her mask at my request? I’ll wager she
regretted it an instant later. Well, she did not see my
face, so I may devour her visually in perfect safety.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And her companion?” Van Zandt goes on meditatively.
“Not her husband, assuredly. Too old for that.
More likely her father, or perhaps her guardian. They
are going to Cuba, so she told me. Well, I am going to
Cuba, too. I may meet her there. Friendships are easily
cultivated in a foreign land. My dear Van Zandt, is it
possible that you are becoming interested in a woman?
Careful; you forget who you are,” he concludes bitterly,
and stares moodily out upon the crowded street.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton and Miss Hathaway are breakfasting leisurely,
unconscious of the interest they have aroused in
the gentleman at the next table. Mr. Felton is scanning
the columns of the Hemisphere, with particular reference
to the full dispatches from Cuba and Madrid. Suddenly
he drops the paper with the exclamation: “This is very
unfortunate!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is unfortunate?” inquires Miss Hathaway, sipping
her coffee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is a dispatch from Havana, stating that the
government has ordered a complete blockade of the
island and that all steamship engagements to and from
Cuba have been canceled for an indefinite period.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway looks up in mild dismay. “Then we
cannot leave Saturday,” she says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would seem not. Ah, here is something more. The
newspaper has looked up the report at the New York
end and finds it to be true. The steamer City of Havana
of the Red Star line, this paper says, will probably be the
last passenger vessel to leave New York for Cuba until
the blockade is raised.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But can we not go on that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton reads on: “The City of Havana sails to-day
at 11 o’clock.” Then he glances at his watch. “It is now
nearly 10. Perhaps we can make it. Wait, I will ascertain
from the clerk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton rises, and as he turns to leave the dining-room
Van Zandt gets a view of his face, and he starts
as if from a nightmare.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That face again!” he breathes. “That face, which has
haunted my dreams and has been before me in my waking
hours! And her father! Merciful heaven, it cannot
be. There is a limit to fate’s grotesquerie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway glances in Van Zandt’s direction and
their eyes meet. It is only an instant, but it leaves the
girl somewhat confused and accentuates the young man’s
disorder.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this juncture Mr. Felton returns with the information
that they have little more than an hour to reach
Barclay Street and the North River, from which point the
steamer leaves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then let us go at once. I am ready,” Louise says,
“after I have scribbled a note of explanation to Mr.
Ashley. He was to have lunched with us at 1 o’clock,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After they have gone Van Zandt drops his head upon
his hand, and for the space of ten minutes remains
plunged in thought. Then, to the waiter’s surprise, he
leaves his breakfast untouched and quits the dining-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the office he sees Mr. Felton settling his bill. Outside
the hotel a line of “cabbies” are drawn up and these
Van Zandt looks over critically, finally signaling to one
of them, a jovial, red visaged Irishman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Riley, a lady and gentleman are going from this hotel
to Barclay Street and North River within a few minutes.
I want you to have the job of carrying them,” says Van
Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m agreeable, sor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After you have secured the job, I want you to miss the
steamer which sails for Cuba at 11 o’clock. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Riley puckers up his mouth for a whistle which he decides
to suppress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure that would not be hard, sor. It’s tin o’clock
now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here they come now. Look to your job,” says Van
Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton and Miss Hathaway emerge from the hotel,
followed by a porter with their trunks. Amid a chorus
of “Keb, sir!” “Keb!” “Keb!” in which Riley sings a
heavy bass, Mr. Felton looks about him in perplexity,
and finally, as though annoyed by the importunities of
Riley, who is rather overdoing his part, he selects a rival
“cabbie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Riley turns somewhat sheepishly to Van Zandt, who
looks after the disappearing carriage in vexation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I run them down, sor?” asks the Irishman, with
a wink which means volumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you prevent them reaching the pier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure, I think so, your honor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll give you $50 if you do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be hivens! I’d murdther thim for that,” exclaims
Riley, as he leaps to his box.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two cabs proceeded at a smart pace down Fifth
Avenue, but as the congested trucking district is reached
progress becomes slower.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you make the pier in time?” Mr. Felton asks the
driver anxiously, consulting his watch for the dozenth
time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure thing,” is the confident response.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither the driver nor his passengers see the cab behind
them. Riley has his reins grasped tightly in one
hand, his whip in the other, and the expression on
his round red face indicates that he is preparing for
something out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class='c011'>They have now reached lower West Broadway, and
before Mr. Felton’s driver knows it he has become entangled
in a rapidly created blockade.</p>

<p class='c011'>Progress now is snail-like. Mr. Felton becomes nervous,
while Miss Hathaway finds much to interest her in
the seemingly inextricable tangle of trucks, drays, horse
cars, cabs, etc. Suddenly a space of a dozen feet or so
opens before them, and the driver is about to take advantage
of it when Riley gives his horse a cut with the whip
and bumps by, nearly taking a wheel off the other cab.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then ensues a duel of that picturesque profanity without
which no truck blockade could possibly be disentangled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Riley, who is ordinarily one of the most good-natured
of mortals, becomes suddenly sensitive under the abuse
heaped upon him and dragging the rival cabman from
his box he proceeds to handle him in a manner that
affords keen delight to the onlookers.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a snappy morning and Riley rather enjoys the
exercise he is taking. But it is suddenly ended by a
brace of policemen, who struggle upon the scene and
pounce upon the combatants. Explanations are then
in order and peace is restored. No one is arrested.</p>

<p class='c011'>Riley is willing to break away, for as he looks around
he notes with satisfaction that the blockade has increased
to unusual proportions and he awaits serenely its slow
unraveling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Mr. Felton is invoking the vials of wrath
upon all cabmen, past, present and to come. It is nearly
11:30 when they reach the pier and, as they expect, the
steamer has gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t my fault, mum,” the “cabbie” explains apologetically.
“Him’s the chap what done it,” indicating
Riley, who has driven up to the pier with the triumphant
flourish of a winner in a great race.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton casts a withering look upon the jolly Irishman.
“We may as well return to the hotel,” he tells
Louise.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment Van Zandt steps from his cab, and,
raising his hat, remarks:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trust that the carelessness of my driver has not
caused you serious annoyance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has prevented our catching the last steamer that
will sail for Cuba in probably some months,” replies
Mr. Felton, tartly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You blockhead!” cries Van Zandt sternly, turning to
Riley, who averts his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear sir, it is needless for me to assure you of my
profound regret. It will not help matters. The mischief
is done—and yet I think I can repair it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Repair it?” repeats Mr. Felton. “In what possible
way, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very easily, if you desire. You were going to Havana,
I presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My yacht sails for Santiago this afternoon at 1 o’clock.
I shall be happy to land you at that port, and you may
thence proceed by rail to Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton and Louise look at each other in surprise.
“Really, sir,” says the former, “you are very good, but
I do not see how we can put you to such trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I assure you that you will not inconvenience me in
the slightest. The yacht is large and you will be the
only passengers, with one exception.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton hesitates. “How badly does he want to go
to Cuba?” wonders Van Zandt and he remarks: “This
will probably be your only chance to reach Havana in
some little time, if, as you say, there are no more steamers.
Really, I almost feel like insisting on your accepting
my offer, as some sort of reparation for the annoyance
to which you have been put and for which I feel
partly responsible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But a blockade has been declared about the island.
Your yacht—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My yacht will land you at Santiago,” supplies Van
Zandt, with a peculiar smile. “We sail in about an
hour, and we may as well proceed to the yacht at once.
For I assume that you have decided to permit me to atone
for the blackguardly behavior of my driver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton consults Miss Hathaway and the matter is
decided in the affirmative, and as Van Zandt hands them
into their coupe, he tells the driver: “North River, foot
of Twenty-third Street.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour later Miss Hathaway is expressing her admiration
for the beautiful yacht that is soon to bear her to
the tropics, and Capt. Beals is giving the last orders
preparatory to getting under way.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Van Zandt watches Mr. Felton cross from the pier
to the deck of the Semiramis into his dark eyes comes a
glitter of almost savage satisfaction, and he murmurs:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have you safe now, and by George! You will not
soon escape me!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE PENALTY OF PROCRASTINATION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>A pencil of sunlight has struggled through the heavy
draperies at the windows and laid a tiny straight line
across the carpet in the comfortable apartments of Jack
Ashley on West Thirty-fourth Street. The oriole timepiece
on the mantel chimes the hour of 9 when that
individual awakens with a series of prodigious yawns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fifteen minutes more and Ashley’s toilet is complete,
and with heels elevated to a comfortable angle, he proceeds
to scan the pages of his morning paper. His own
story of the French ball first claims his attention, and
with a comment of satisfaction on the size of the headlines
with which it is introduced, he runs his eye approvingly
over the dozen or so illustrations with which the
article is embellished.</p>

<p class='c011'>A scare head of the largest size catches his eye, and
with awakening interest he reads the sensational headlines.
“Gaining Ground—Cuban Revolutionists Driving
Spaniards before Them—Hemisphere’s Exclusive Interview
with Senor Manada Creates Excitement in Washington—United
States Man-of-War to Be Sent to Cuba
to protect American Interests,” and much more of the
same tenor. As Jack skims over the voluminous dispatches
that follow the head, he reads with interest one
brief item, dated Santiago de Cuba, via Nassau, N. P. It
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Government is redoubling its efforts to suppress
the news, and is apparently determined that the press
of the United States and elsewhere shall not learn the
exact state of affairs on the island. Nine-tenths of the
local newspaper men have been fined by the press censor.
Several editions of the leading papers have been seized,
and telegrams for transmission abroad from eastern
Cuba are now absolutely forbidden. It is also a fact that
foreign correspondents have been threatened with expulsion.
The Spanish authorities allege that the mysterious
steamer fired upon by the warship Galicia was
not the American ward liner Santiago, but a rebel vessel
which the insurrectionists have purchased in the United
States and fitted up as a gunboat. A blockade of all the
ports of the island, as previously intimated, has been
formally announced.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It looks as if the paper would be obliged to send a
man down there,” Ashley reflects, as he struggles into his
topcoat. “What a superb day for the trial trip,” as he
opens the street door and steps into the sunlight. “And
this is the day, too, that Barker is to arrest Felton. He
didn’t specify any time, probably not till afternoon, anyway.
I almost wish I wasn’t assigned to that trial trip.
I should like to interview him after the arrest. However,
my story is all written up and I can get the details
of the arrest from Barker after I return from the America.
I wonder how Miss Hathaway will take the affair,” a
softer light shining in his eyes as his thoughts revert
to the beautiful ward of Cyrus Felton. “She treats him
with the utmost deference and respect, but I cannot
think that she cares especially for him. Heigho! Now
for a cup of coffee and then for another tete-a-tete with
the beautiful unknown of the Raymond hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is on the stroke of 10 as Ashley saunters up to the
clerk’s desk in the Kensington and requests that his
card, upon which he has penciled a few lines explaining
his identity, be taken to Mrs. Winthrop.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Winthrop?” the urbane clerk repeats. “There
is no such lady stopping here, to my knowledge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is nonplused. So he has been duped, he thinks,
by the fair unknown. But why has not Barker kept his
agreement? A nice sort of a shadow if he cannot follow
as striking-looking a woman as “Mrs. Winthrop.”
But stay! Perhaps she has given a fictitious name, but
is actually stopping at the Kensington after all. Barker
could not have slipped upon a simple matter like that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Abstractedly twirling his glove, Jack leans over the
desk and says in a low tone to the clerk, an old acquaintance:
“Is there a rather striking-looking young woman,
with dark eyes and midnight hair, stopping at the house?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The clerk smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sorry, Jack, but you are too late, I’m afraid. The
beautiful Mrs. Harding left at 9 o’clock, bag and baggage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley turns thoughtfully away and repairs to the
reading-room for a quiet think. So her name—for the
present at least—is Mrs. Harding. But where is Barker?
The detective is probably shadowing Mrs. Harding now.
Ashley concludes that there is nothing for him to do but
await Barker’s return. He has been on the watch barely
half an hour when the detective swings himself from a
cable car in front of the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” is Jack’s impatient salutation as he leads the
way to a retired corner of the reading-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker is not in exuberant spirits; his brows are
knitted in a frown and he is nervously biting his mustache.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, she has gone—left town, and is apparently en
route from the country—for Cuba, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For Cuba!” and Jack stares at the detective in mild
amaze. Verily, either a most remarkable series of
coincidences or the tangled threads of the Raymond
mystery are pointing unmistakably to the fair isle of the
Antilles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, for Cuba. Let me impress it upon your mind
in the beginning that Mrs. Isabel Harding—that’s the
name she is sailing under—is no ordinary woman. Why—but
to begin at the beginning. According to our
understanding last night, I followed her to this hotel,
where I found she was actually stopping. I naturally
concluded that she made the engagement with you in
good faith, else she would have given another hotel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She did give me a fictitious name,” breaks in Jack.
“Or, rather, she led me to believe that her name was still
Winthrop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she? Well, that was useless. Anyhow, I decided
to stop here last night, to be on guard early this
morning. I found that my lady had breakfasted early.
This made me suspicious and I kept close watch of her.
Shortly after 9 o’clock she settled her bill at the hotel and
with her trunks was driven to the Jersey City ferry. Of
course I followed. At the Pennsylvania depot she was
joined by a foreign-looking chap—Spaniard. Quite a
distinguished-looking duffer. If you should ever run
across him you will know him by a small, crescent-shaped
scar on his left cheek. I was successful in getting
close enough to them to hear some of the conversation.
It appeared from their talk, Ashley, that your Mrs. Harding
is, in addition to her other accomplishments, a spy
in the pay of the Spanish Government, and that she has
been successful in learning some of the secret plans and
plots of the Cuban filibusters in this city. She is now
on her way to Port Tampa aboard the Florida limited,
and I should judge it is their intention to proceed from
Key West at once to Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their intention? Did the Spanish officer accompany
her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker nods. “He looked as if he was right out of
the hospital; his head was bandaged. Perhaps some of
the Cuban sympathizers had it out with him. However,
that episode is closed, for the present at least. And now
for Cyrus Felton. I shall take him directly to the Tombs,
and according to our compact he will be invisible to any
of the newspaper fraternity. Will you come with me to
the St. James while I nab the bird?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley starts. He has for a moment forgotten the
catastrophe that is about to overcome Cyrus Felton. He
looks at his watch. “I am overdue at the office,” he
says. “But say, Barker, I had an engagement to lunch
with Felton and Miss Hathaway at 1 o’clock. Can’t you
put off the arrest until to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker shakes his head. “Not a minute,” he replies,
emphatically. “I have delayed long enough. If you
intended to lunch with the fair Miss Hathaway you will
have an opportunity to do so just the same and your
presence will doubtless be appreciated in her tremendous
confusion. If you can’t come with me I will drop round
at the office and see you later.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, then. Do the job in as gentlemanly a manner
as possible,” grins Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker nods and walks rapidly toward the St. James,
while Ashley boards a Broadway car and rolls downtown.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective saunters up to the hotel office desk,
writes the name “Cyrus Felton” on a bit of cardboard,
and, passing it to the clerk, inquires: “Is that gentleman
in?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; gone. Left an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When will he return?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that’s rather beyond me,” smiles the clerk.
“Mr. Felton and a lady sailed this morning for Cuba,
on the City of Havana. I assume that they did. They
were driven from here to the pier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What time does the steamer sail?” asks Barker, taking
out his watch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Too late!” grits the detective. It is even now five
minutes past the hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Barker permits his emotions to master
his self-possession, and he startles even the debonair
clerk, accustomed as the latter is to the strong terms
sometimes employed by irritable guests.</p>

<p class='c011'>His feelings relieved in a measure by this unusual outbreak,
the detective sits down for a moment to consider
the situation. Cyrus Felton, then, is on his way to Cuba,
doubtless to join his son. Mrs. Harding, a valuable
quantity in the mystery, is also headed for the Antilles.
Everything seems to point to Cuba. Barker picks up a
railroad timetable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Twelve m.; Florida express for Savannah, Jacksonville
and Port Tampa,” he reads.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the gods, I’ll do it!” he exclaims, as he starts for
the street. “First to the pier and make sure that the
steamer has gone, and, if so, then to Key West. I shall
be only two hours behind the woman, and I may reach
Havana ahead of Felton. Hi, there, cabby!”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE CRUISER AMERICA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Jack, Mr. Ricker wants to see you,” is the information
extended to Ashley when he reaches the office. He reports
at the room of the city editor, and that gentleman
informs him that he has not arrived any too soon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that I am an hour or so behind, but I have
been working up a story that will make interesting reading,”
Ashley explains. “What’s up? My trial-trip assignment
isn’t until 3, is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The start was set for 3, but it has been pushed forward
to 1 o’clock,” says Ricker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is about noon now. I may as well start for Brooklyn
at once. Good, snappy day for a run down the bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunder!” says Ashley, when he reaches the street.
“I had forgotten that I was booked for a consolatory
lunch with Miss Hathaway at 1. I must send my regrets.
Hang it, that will look as if I was on to the
arrest and was afraid to show up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he sends the note, nevertheless, and feels better in
mind. “If that cold-blooded Barker only handles the
matter properly,” he thinks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as he reaches the Government dock Jack sees the
pennant of Capt. Meade run up to the main truck of the
cruiser whose initial trial in commission he is to report;
he is none too soon for the gang-plank is being withdrawn
by half a score of blue-clad sailors as he makes a
flying leap and lands upon the deck of the newest and
fastest acquisition to Uncle Sam’s navy, the cruiser
America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere Jack has fully recovered his footing a youthful-appearing
midshipman brusquely demands his business.</p>

<p class='c011'>It takes sometime before Jack is permitted to tread
the sacred precincts of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade is for the time being on the bridge, and,
before making the acquaintance of the commander, Jack
proceeds to look about the vessel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The America has an air of being a ship made for
getting there; an up-to-date cruiser, without frills and
furbelows, but distinctively with an aspect of power. In
the bright sunlight her snowy hull gleams like polished
marble. Her four great smokestacks relieve in a measure
the glaring effect of her big white bulk, while the
polished brass and steel with which all the decks are gird-ironed
suggest, without the presence of the murderous
rapid-fire and revolving cannon stationed about the
decks, that the vessel is designed for war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is soon engaged in the collection of information
regarding the America for the benefit of Hemisphere
readers. The cruiser is, the second officer informs him,
of over 7,000 tons displacement. Her battery comprises
two six-inch, 40-caliber rapid-fire guns, one on each side,
forward of the superstructure; one eight-inch, 40-caliber
on the center line, abaft the superstructure; eight four-inch
rapid-fire guns in armored sponsons on the gundeck,
four on each side; six-pounder rapid-fire guns,
four-pounders, one-pounders, Gatlings and torpedo tubes
galore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are three vertical, triple-expansion engines,
each set driving a separate screw. The propellers are
of manganese bronze and the—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, that is sufficient, I guess,” interrupts Jack.
“The Hemisphere readers will have a very good idea of
the offensive and defensive power of the America now,
I am sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The cruiser is slowly backing out into the stream.
There is a big throng on the pier to watch her departure,
and a whole battery of cameras are leveled as she finally
swings around.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the ship becomes indeed instinct with life and is
pointing down the bay with a speed that augurs well for
the shattering of records. The whistles of all the craft
in sight screech a salute and the America’s hoarse whistle
bellows responsively. Past the Battery and Governor’s
Island she speeds and then, fairly by quarantine, the
patent log is cast into the foamy wake and Capt. Meade
rings “full speed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The speed trial of the America has actually begun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack is idly watching the rapidly receding island, when
he becomes aware by the slight bustle on the quarterdeck
that the commander of the America has returned from
the bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade, or “Fighting Dave,” as he is affectionately
designated in naval circles, is a man of about 60
years, but forty-five years of his eventful career have been
spent in the navy. He has worked himself up, without
political or social influence, from apprentice boy to commander
of the newest and best cruiser in the United
States.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack has heard of “Fighting Dave,” and he scans the
famous naval officer with much interest. A figure
slightly below the average, but stockily built; a cheerful
visage, face weather-beaten and innocent of beard,
surmounted by a shock of grizzly hair; eyes whose keen
expression might well belie the jovial look upon the face—this
is Capt. David Meade, U.S.N.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good face,” thinks Ashley, as he completes his
scrutiny. “I should like to know Capt. Meade personally,
and I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With his customary assurance and easy grace Ashley
approaches the autocrat of the quarterdeck and tenders
his card.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade glances at the pasteboard and then his
keen eyes wander to the newspaper man. Apparently
the scrutiny is satisfactory, for the bronzed face wrinkles
into the most benign of smiles and a tremendous fist
grasps Jack’s right hand with a grip which causes him
to mentally question his ability to write up the trial trip,
or anything else, for a week at least.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you are from the Hemisphere?” Capt. Meade observes.
“Well, I like that paper and one of its representatives
is heartily welcome to my ship. In these days
of sentiment and gush and peace and good-will and
brotherly love, and so forth, and so forth, it does my
heart good to get hold of a paper which isn’t afraid nor
ashamed to speak right out in meetin’ for the land we live
in and the flag that floats above it. But come below, Mr.
Ashley, and we’ll clinch the sentiment with a toast.” And
the captain leads the way to his sumptuous quarters,
where the “splicing of the main brace” is accomplished
with alacrity and vigor by commander and newspaper
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what do you think of the America?” asks the
captain. “Did you ever see anything like that on a
vessel going over twenty knots an hour?” setting his
glass, filled to the brim, on the table. The surface of
the liquid is scarce more ruffled than that of a mirror.
“No sign of vibration, eh? She stands up as steady as
a house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack is really surprised as he considers the circumstances.
“From what little I have seen of her I should
say she is a remarkable craft and one that Uncle Sam
should feel proud of,” he replies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remarkable? She’s a wonder! Why, she can walk
away from anything that floats—anything, big or little,
torpedo catchers or stilettos. I was on her when her
first trial trip with the builders aboard took place, and
while she made twenty-five knots then, she can do better.
And she is going to do it to-day. Before we reach
Sandy Hook, young man, you can just put it down in
your log-book that the American flag is being borne over
the water faster than any other flag is likely to be carried
for some time. One more splice and then we’ll show
you how the trick is done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the captain and his guest return to the quarterdeck
of the cruiser it is apparent that something unusual is
attracting the attention of officers and crew. Those who
are not actively engaged in the manipulation of the
cruiser are gathered at the port rail watching intently a
steamer that is running parallel with the America, about
an eighth of a mile distant and about three lengths astern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Mr. Jones?” inquires Capt. Meade of the
third officer, who has just removed the binocular glasses
from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A strange craft, sir, evidently a yacht which is apparently
using the America as a pacemaker. She pulled
up astern of us fifteen minutes ago, and has since been
steadily gaining. Very fast, sir, I should say, but she
bears no ensign or pennant of any kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade takes the glasses from the hands of his
subaltern and looks long and critically at the strange
vessel. She is nearly the same length as the America,
though manifestly of considerable less tonnage. And
she is painted black, without a bit of gay color from stem
to stern to relieve the somberness of her hull.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two black smokestacks, that appear unusually large
and are set at a decidedly rakish angle, are relieved by
two narrow bands of white. Capt. Meade with a seaman’s
appreciative eye admires the shapely lines of the
yacht, but as his practiced vision notices the comparative
ease with which she is creeping up on the America his
jovial face becomes slightly troubled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Jones, have the log taken and work out our speed
at once,” he orders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Twenty-four and a quarter knots,” is the report.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the next ten minutes the captain watches intently
the strange yacht. Her course is apparently shaped precisely
parallel with that of the America, and she still
continues to gain, inch by inch, upon the white cruiser.
Now she is amidships, and now the two vessels are on
even terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>A puff of white steam rises abaft the stranger’s big
smokestacks, and a long shrill whistle salutes the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c011'>’Tis a challenge for a race and it stirs Capt. Meade’s
blood to fever heat. He sends for the chief engineer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is the machinery working?” he inquires.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Finely, sir; not the sign of the slightest trouble anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, sir; we will begin now to push her for a
record. Put on every ounce of steam she will stand,
first with natural and afterward with forced draught.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief engineer salutes, and returns to his domain,
and a second later the hoarse whistle of the America
sounds a defiant acceptance of the challenge of the black
yacht.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>GREAT RACE TO THE OCEAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“By Jove! I had no idea the captain had so much
sporting blood in his veins,” murmurs Jack Ashley to
himself, as he watches alternately the challenging craft
and the America. “It is a race fit for a king’s delectation.
I wonder whose yacht that is. I don’t remember
seeing her described in any of the papers, as she certainly
would have been if she were owned in New York. She
is a big one, and a beauty, too. And swift as the wind!
But she doesn’t seem to be gaining now. No, by
Jupiter! We are gaining on her! The America has
struck her gait at last! But that’s a game craft there.
She sticks to us like a leech and refuses to be shaken
off. Ah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The impromptu race has been in progress nearly half
an hour, and the two vessels, still less than an eighth
of a mile apart, are gradually drawing nearer each other.
It is apparent that the yacht is determined to continue
the race at closer range, and has changed her course for
that purpose. Meanwhile the big cruiser has held to her
original course, and as the yacht straightens away for
another parallel run she has lost her former advantage
and the two vessels are practically on even terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a battle royal!</p>

<p class='c011'>The white cruiser is cleaving the water with tremendous
speed, her bow sending the spray curling nearly
as high as her armored top, while the waves astern are
churned by her triple screws into a foam that extends
as far as the eye can reach. The roaring of her furnaces
is audible above the whir of the machinery and the
whistling of the wind through the rigging. From her
three great smokestacks steadily increasing masses of
inky smoke trail out above the snowy wake.</p>

<p class='c011'>All eyes on the deck of the cruiser are riveted on the
yacht. For a short space of time it looks as if both vessels
might be propelled by the same power, so even are
their relative positions. Then, to the practical eyes
aboard the cruiser, it is apparent that the America is
drawing ahead, slowly to be sure, and imperceptibly to
the untrained eye, but still gaining.</p>

<p class='c011'>A dozen yards, a quarter length, a half, a clear length
ahead!</p>

<p class='c011'>A hearty cheer is trembling on the lips of the crew
of the cruiser, but it is not uttered. The race is still unfinished,
the victory still hangs in the balance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like a thoroughbred that has been feeling her antagonist,
the yacht now seems to respond to some undeveloped
power. The cruiser gains no more—she is
losing her advantage. The watchers on the quarterdeck
of the America can see the black prow lessening the
open water that separates the two craft. Now her bow
laps the stern of the America, but not for long. She is
overhauling the cruiser faster now, and in a few minutes—seconds,
it seems to the anxious spectators on the
latter vessel—she is abeam of the America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out beyond Sandy Hook, where the billows flash into
curving crests like the manes of wild horses, a great fleet
has gathered to watch the race against time of the famous
warship. Instead it is their privilege to witness a race
between two of the swiftest sea hounds ever unleashed
on the trail of the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the impromptu armada the racers speed over
the toppling seas. A thousand glasses are upon them.
What does it mean? The white cruiser all may recognize,
but her sable-hulled consort, what is she? Straight
out from staff and halyards the wind whips the flag and
ensigns of the America, but neither ensign nor flag does
the strange steamship show, and except for the great
white wake that trails behind her she might be a phantom
ship, another Flying Dutchman.</p>

<p class='c011'>But ere the “reviewing stand” recovers from its first
surprise, both craft are miles away, black bow and white
bow piling over hills of foam like sleighs over snowdrifts
and the surge that goes sobbing along the glistening
sides of the cruiser, inaudible above the roar of her
mighty engines, sounds like the weeping for a lost race.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the black hull is bow and bow with the white, as,
after a long and critical survey of the yacht from the
bridge, Capt. Meade descends to the deck and summons
the chief engineer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everything is working finely, sir,” that official reports.
“We are steaming the extreme limit under natural
draught. Shall we try the forced now, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade hesitates and again gazes long at the yacht.
The latter has now a clear length of open water to the
good and her stern is presented squarely in view for the
first time. The single word Semiramis is inscribed thereon
in gold letters. But no port is designated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Semiramis,” murmurs the commander of the
America. “I never heard of the craft before, but her
name will be on every man’s lips before long, I’ll wager.”
Then to the chief engineer: “Yes, put on the forced
draught.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack Ashley wipes the marine glasses with which the
thoughtfulness of the second officer has provided him,
and turns them again toward the afterdeck of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, may I be keelhauled, or some other equally
condign nautical punishment,” he mutters, after a long
look. “If that isn’t Louise Hathaway, seated in a
steamer chair, then do my optics play me strange pranks.
But what is she doing on the deck of that yacht? She
appears to be alone; at least there is no other lady
passenger on deck. Ah, there is Mr. Felton. So Barker
was too late. Felton and Miss Hathaway must be the
guests of the gay yachtsman who is making ducks and
drakes of the America on her trial trip.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunder and Mars!” cries the newspaper man, nearly
dropping the glasses to the deck. “Phillip Van Zandt!
He is apparently the owner of the yacht. Good heavens!
What irony of fate brings together those two participants
in the Raymond tragedy. For Van Zandt is Ernest
Stanley, I will swear it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as the novelists say, the plot thickens. How
did Van Zandt ingratiate himself into the good graces
of Cyrus Felton? It must have been recently, for Miss
Hathaway spoke as if they had no friends in the city.
Hang it all! I don’t just fancy the situation. How
assiduously he is waiting upon her now! Heigho, Jack!
I think I would as soon have reported this trial trip from
the deck of the Semiramis.” At which thought Ashley
impatiently pitches over the rail the remains of one of
Capt. Meade’s favorite brand of cigars.</p>

<p class='c011'>The black plumes of smoke that pour from the chimneys
of the America are becoming denser and larger.
The forced draught is now fully in operation, and in the
boiler-rooms the half-naked stokers ceaselessly feed the
greedy fires.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cruiser has reached the limit of her speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>How is it with the Semiramis?</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time the America seems to hold her own and
even to gain slightly. But the advantage is transitory.
The yacht still apparently has speed in reserve. Once
more she leaps forward and not again is opportunity
afforded the America’s people to view her gleaming
sides.</p>

<p class='c011'>For another hour both vessels are driven at their
highest speed. The Semiramis continues to gain upon
the America, and is now nearly a quarter of a mile ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later Capt. Meade sees a flag run up to
the masthead of the vanishing yacht. He gives an order
and the cruiser’s forward gun booms a salute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you make of that ensign, Mr. Smith?” inquires
the commander, turning to the second officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A strange flag, sir, not the flag of any nation that I
recall,” is the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I have it,” suddenly exclaims the captain. “Well,
she is a great craft and magnificently handled. The
America made a gallant fight against odds and lost; but
you can say, Mr. Ashley,” as that individual ascends the
steps to the bridge, “that the America has broken all
records in the navies of the world, and for two consecutive
hours has exceeded twenty-seven knots an hour.
Yonder craft has beaten that time, but she has not the
heavy armament of the America.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was the ensign she ran up a moment ago,
captain?” Ashley asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That, sir,” replies Capt. Meade, “was the flag of Cuba
Libre, the emblem of the sometime republic of the
Antilles!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>ASHLEY LAGS SUPERFLUOUS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“If she is the property of the revolutionists, gentlemen,
with her phenomenal speed she can run the strictest
blockade the Spaniards can institute, can land arms, ammunition
and re-enforcements at will, and practically
snap her fingers at the whole Spanish navy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The speaker is Capt. Meade and the place the officers’
mess table on board the America. Naturally the one
topic of conversation is the strange yacht and her remarkable
performance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” continues the captain, impressively, “I believe
that the result of the insurrection may hang on the fate
of that steamer. My sympathies as an individual, I do not
hesitate to say, are with the rebels. But my duty as an
officer impels me to notify the War Department of the
departure of the Semiramis and the flaunting of the
Cuban flag. However, I hardly think the warning will
harm her, even if it should set the entire Spanish navy
in pursuit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think the yacht is bound for Cuba now?”
inquires Ashley, with an unpleasant sensation in the
vicinity of the fifth rib.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly. She is apparently coaled and equipped
for a long voyage. She set low enough in the water to
carry quite a cargo, too. Oh, yes; she is off for the
West Indies sure enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley relapses into a reverie and the burden of his
thoughts is something like this: “Louise Hathaway,
Cyrus Felton and this mysterious Van Zandt on the same
steamer and bound for Cuba! How and why?” He
mechanically pulls at his cigar. Finally, as the signal
for breaking up of the dinner party is given by the commander,
he murmurs: “What will John Barker say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The America has completed her run; and now, her
officers and the naval experts aboard having expressed
their satisfaction with her performance, the cruiser is
steaming back to her dock. The shrill salutes of the
many steam craft in the harbor greet the ears of Ashley
as he accompanies the officers to the deck. The sun is
shining in a haze of cold gray. The March air, a few
hours ago so clear and warm, is dull and marrow-piercing.
Ashley shivers and buttons his coat more
closely about him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few moments more, and the cruiser is slowing down
preparatory to making her pier, and Jack seeks Capt.
Meade to express his thanks. The latter shakes his
hand cordially and remarks: “Better come on our next
cruise, my boy; we may have another try at the black
yacht. The navy expert says it was rumored in official
circles that if this trial was satisfactory the America is to
be ordered immediately to Cuba to protect American
interests. Good news, if true, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley allows that if the captain says it is good news,
good news it certainly must be; and a half-defined hope
is forming in his mind as he steps once more on terra
firma.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After I turn in my story on the trial trip I shall proceed
to hunt up some possible light on the latest twist
in the Hathaway tangle,” he meditates, as he sets his
face toward the lights of Gotham town. “Felton and
Miss Hathaway were booked to sail on the City of Callao
on Saturday; yet I discover them to-day headed southward
on the Semiramis. Miss Hathaway must have left
some explanation, and it is barely possible that Barker
may know something about the sudden departure. I
should not be a particle surprised if John, too, were
aboard the Semiramis. Nothing will ever surprise me
again. But if Barker got left I shall probably find him
sitting on the steps of the Hemisphere office, in a state
of mind bordering on the profane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But fate decrees that many days shall elapse ere the
detective and his newspaper friend again clasp each other
by the hand; days big with exciting events that the
serene Ashley dreams not of as he saunters down Newspaper
Row.</p>

<p class='c011'>From his box in the office Ashley extracts a letter,
evidently hastily written and sealed. The address is in
Barker’s handwriting, and Ashley tears it open. He
reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Dear Ashley: I start for Cuba at 12 o’clock via Key
West. Write this just before the train starts. Felton has eluded
me—thanks to your infernal French ball—and sailed for
Cuba on City of Havana at 11 o’clock. Don’t know whether
he got wind of contemplated arrest or not. If I have good
luck at Key West will be in H. as soon as he. May trail him
to the son and bag both at once. In any event, do not intend
to lose sight of him again till he is safely landed in Vermont.
I may run across your Mrs. Harding, and if I do will try my
luck at making her tell what she knows of young Felton, on
threat of exposing her as a Spanish spy. Good scheme, eh?
Must close, train starting; will write from Cuba. Hastily,</p>
<div class='c017'>“Barker.”</div>

<p class='c016'>“So Cuba is to be the scene of the next act of the
Raymond tragedy,” Jack thinks. “How suddenly all the
characters have betaken themselves to the southern isle,
and how events have crowded on each other the last day
or two! First, news that young Felton is in Cuba; then
appear Cyrus Felton and Louise Hathaway in the city;
then the mysterious woman of the Raymond hotel, and
the stranger of the mountain gorge—and all of these are
at this moment en route to Cuba. Only Derrick Ames
and Helen Hathaway remain to be accounted for, and if
Barker’s theory is correct, and they, too, are in Cuba,
what a situation and what a complication! I must be
there at the finish. The paper really needs a war correspondent
in the ever-faithful isle, and I’ve half a mind to
ask for the assignment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From his desk Ashley takes a bulky package of manuscript,
glances through it, and with a sigh replaces it
within an inner compartment. “The Raymond mystery
story, the newspaper beat of the year,” is not to be
used yet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the account of the trial trip of the America must
be written, and soon the sheaves of yellow paper are
being rapidly covered by Jack’s flying pen.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last it is finished, and with a grunt of satisfaction
Jack arranges the scattered sheets and proceeds to the
desk of the city editor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Ashley,” remarks that dignitary, glancing at the
manuscript and without raising his eyes; “trial trip was
a success, wasn’t it? Yes; well, I have a little something
here that I wish you would look up. You have done so
much Cuban stuff lately that you are more familiar with
the ground than any other man on the staff. The
Washington wire states that a vessel, the Isabel, that was
to have sailed from here to-day, has been detained at her
moorings, foot of Twenty-third Street. She is suspected
of having arms and ammunition for the Cuban rebels on
board. The information was filed by the Spanish minister.
Just look up the local end of the story, find out
who fitted out the steamer, where she was ostensibly to
clear for, etc. You had better see your filibuster friend,
Manada. He might give you something on it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blast Cuba!” mutters Jack, as he leaves the office.
“Everything is Cuba now. Talk about Tantalus! His
case wasn’t a marker to mine. Here are all the characters
in a drama in which I am interested gone to Cuba,
while I lag superfluous on the stage, doomed to write
up stuff about the confounded island and its affairs at
long range. Besides, I haven’t fairly got back my land
legs, and now I must jaunt up the North River two or
three miles. Well, there is no use kicking, I suppose.
Guess I will look up Don Manada first, though.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s annoyance dissipates rapidly, however, and he
has recovered his customary serenity when he tenders his
card to the clerk at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, to be taken
to Don Manada’s rooms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Manada has left, sir” the clerk tells him. “He
had his effects removed early this morning and stated
that he might not return for some months.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where has he gone, do you know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Cuba, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack turns away. “To Cuba, of course. Everybody
with whom I have business to-day has gone to Cuba. If
that filibustering vessel, the Isabel, has not eluded the
officers and sailed for Cuba by the time I reach her
wharf, I shall be mightily surprised. No; I have decided
to be surprised at nothing hereafter. The Isabel!
There’s another coincidence—the first name of Mrs.
Harding or Mrs. Winthrop or whatever it is—the woman
of the Raymond Hotel. Well, here goes for the Isabel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is cold, foggy, dark and altogether disagreeable as
Jack alights from the car at the foot of Twenty-third
Street and picks his way down the long wharf to where
he is informed the detained steamer is docked. She is
still there; he sees her smokestacks and masts outlined
against the sky. A single lantern is alight on the vessel,
but the gang-plank has been hauled in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Steamer ahoy!” Ashley calls, and after several repetitions
of the hail a gruff voice sounds from the gloom
in the vicinity of the lantern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ashore, there! What do you want?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is this the Isabel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” is the brief reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I want to talk with you a moment. Can’t you
run out a plank and hold that lantern nearer, so I can see
to come aboard? I am from the Hemisphere.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a moment’s hesitation and then the lantern
approaches the steamer’s side and a plank is extended to
the pier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, all I want to find out is about the alleged seizure
of the vessel,” begins Jack, thrusting a cigar into the fist
that releases the lantern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There ain’t much to say,” is the reply. “I am a United
States deputy marshal and was placed in charge of the
vessel this noon. Whether her cargo contains arms and
ammunition I can’t say for sure, as she is not to be
searched till to-morrow, but from the remarks dropped by
some of the crew I’ll bet a hat the cargo has been taken
off. One of the crew was considerably under the weather
when I came aboard and I gathered from his talk that
some of the Isabel’s cargo was shifted to another steamer,
a long, black craft, some time after midnight or early this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was the name of the other steamer?” inquires
Ashley, a sudden suspicion entering his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blessed if I know,” replies the deputy marshal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Semiramis, I’ll wager $4 to a nickel,” mutters
Ashley, as he thanks the marshal and goes ashore.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>ON TO FAIR CUBA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“There are only two bits of evidence needed to complete
my moral conviction that I am the only person
connected with the Raymond tragedy who is not in
Cuba or on his way thither,” remarks Ashley, loquitur, as
he boards a cross-town car. “One is the assurance that
Cyrus Felton and Miss Hathaway have left the St. James
Hotel with no intention of an immediate return; the
other, the knowledge that Phillip Van Zandt has closed
his quarters in the Wyoming flats for an indefinite period.
I believe I will try the St. James first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He does. The clerk smiles benignly upon him when
he inquires for the Vermonters. “Gone, Jack; but you
were not forgotten,” he says. “The day clerk turned this
over to me,” extracting a note from the letter rack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Ed,” acknowledges Ashley. He tears
open the note and reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Mr. Ashley: I regret very much that circumstances
have made it necessary to postpone indefinitely the luncheon
for this afternoon at 1, to which I had looked forward with
much pleasure. We have just learned that in order to reach
Cuba we must sail on the City of Havana, which leaves New
York at 11 o’clock to-day. With many thanks for your kindnesses,
believe me, sincerely yours,</p>
<div class='c017'>Louise Hathaway.”</div>

<p class='c016'>“Far from enlightening me, this note only plunges me
deeper in the fog,” thinks Ashley, sniffing the faint odor
of violet that clings to the dainty stationery. “She asserts
here that she is going to Cuba on the City of Havana,
yet I discover her aboard the Semiramis. At any rate
they have gone to Cuba, and there is no particular reason
for my visiting Van Zandt’s apartments. It is getting
late, anyway, and I believe I will return to the office.
If Ricker is in a good-humored mood I will attempt to
convince him that the only feature which the paper at
present lacks is a live man at Havana who can tell the
difference between an overwhelming Spanish or Cuban
victory and a fifth-rate scrimmage that a dozen New
York policemen could quell in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley swings himself upon a Broadway car and lapses
into a meditation. “How the deuce do Miss Hathaway
and Cyrus Felton come to be aboard the Semiramis?
And if Ernest Stanley is Phillip Van Zandt, where did he
get the money to own such a yacht? Forty or fifty
thousand dollars of Raymond National Bank funds
wouldn’t pay for one side of the Semiramis. But it may
not be his yacht. I have simply assumed so because he
looked as if he owned the ocean as well. Good gracious,
I should be inclined to regard Miss Hathaway’s disappearance
as a clear case of abduction but for the fact
that the fair Louise appeared entirely satisfied with her
surroundings when I focused the America’s glasses upon
her graceful self. I am beginning to believe that I am
clear off my reckoning on Van Zandt. The Semiramis
may be owned by the Cubans and he may simply be one
of the leaders of the expedition. And he may not be
Ernest Stanley at all, although I think—hang it! I don’t
know what I think. I shall quit thinking from now on.
It is too hard work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Much relieved by this determination, Ashley sits at his
desk, lights his briar and dashes off a short sketch of the
detained filibustering vessel. This he tosses over to the
night-desk men, and strolls into the city editor’s den.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you are at leisure, Mr. Ricker, I should like to
bore you for five or ten minutes,” he announces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am at leisure now, Jack. Sit down. It has been a
rather light night and there is an unusual lull just at
present. What is on your mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is something like half a dozen years since I began
work on the paper, is it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just about, my son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And during that time I have never kicked on an
assignment or asked for any particular job.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; if I recollect rightly, that is about the size of
it,” remarks Ricker dryly. “Now, what can I do for
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like the assignment of war correspondent at
Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The city editor is silent for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry you did not speak of this Havana business
before,” he says, encircling the pastepot with a ring of
smoke. “Unfortunately I have mapped out two or three
months’ work for you at a place a good many miles from
the capital of Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s face does not reveal the disappointment he
feels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, Mr. Ricker, I have no kick coming. I will
break another one of my rules and ask what the assignment
is before I have been notified of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is an important mission, my son, and the selection
of the man to fill the place does not come within my department.
But as a good man was needed I urged the
desirability of putting you on the job.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very kind,” murmurs Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I intended to communicate to you his wishes to-night,”
resumes Ricker. “In fact, I received the assignment
for you an hour ago and you would have found it
in your box in the morning.” The city editor tosses over
a yellow envelope and Ashley finds therein the brief notification:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beginning March 18, Mr. Ashley will enter upon the
duties as war correspondent at Santiago de Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley looks up and catches the indulgent smile of his
chief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ricker, you’re a jewel,” he says, warmly, extending
his hand. The friendship between the two men has long
since leveled the wall of official dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had no idea you wanted the job,” smiles the city
editor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Until to-day I had no desire to visit Cuba,” replies
Ashley. “But at present I want to go the worst way—or
the best way. And my wish to reach Cuban soil is not
greatly influenced by personal reasons, either. I expect
some day to turn over to you a story that will cover a
good share of the first page and just now the trail is
winding under the flags of three nations—Spain, Cuba
and the United States. But why Santiago, instead of
Havana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the reason that, as you may see by a look over
to-night’s telegrams, the eastern province of Cuba is
likely to be the principal theater of the struggle for independence.
You know the sort of stuff we want. Statements
of fact, above all. You may have some difficulty
in getting us the facts by wire, as the government controls
the cables; but there are the mails, and in addition
to the usual grind you might send a two or three column
chatty letter every fortnight or so that would be interesting
reading. Spend all the money that is necessary. Get
right out into the fighting; there isn’t one chance in a
million of your being hurt. Above all, send us facts.
We cannot pay too much for facts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you considered how I am to reach Santiago?
You know there are no steamer lines running to the
island.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That has been arranged. The bulletin was received
early this evening that the new cruiser America had been
ordered to Santiago. The managing editor used his influence,
and permission to send a representative on the
vessel has kindly been granted. There is some value in
being on the right side of an administration. The
cruiser sails the day after to-morrow, the 18th.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley and Ricker soon complete their talk and Jack
starts for home in a complacent condition of mind. Arriving
at his rooms he slips into a dressing-gown and
stretches himself in an easy-chair for a smoke-lined
night-cap, and as the rings curl upward he sees
in fancy the various actors in the Raymond drama passing
in review before a tropical background of hazy blue
hills and palm-shaded groves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly he utters an exclamation: “Jupiter! How
is Barker to get to Cuba? He must have shot off to
Key West without reading the morning paper, and he
probably was not aware that there are no steamers running
from Key West any more than from New York or
other ports. When he does learn that fact his remarks
will not be fit for publication. Well, I suppose, he will
get there somehow, even if he has to swim. But in all
probability I shall reach the island before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The trail is plain. It leads to Cuba, and somewhere
in the gem of the Antilles the threads of the Raymond
murder mystery will touch and cross and interweave.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE FLAG OF CUBA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“We shall have a race, Don Manada—a battle royal.
The new United States cruiser America has just steamed
out of the bay ahead of us and we shall soon be abreast
of her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A race, Senor Van Zandt? Santissimo! We shall
have racing enough before we get to Cuba without challenging
unsuspicious warships and courting investigation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt laughs at the Cuban gentleman’s anxious
tones. “I told you, my friend, that once on the high seas
nothing short of a cannon ball can overhaul the Semiramis.
Come on deck in an hour, senor, and I will
prove to you what may now seem an idle boast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For excellent reasons Manada is keeping in the background
as much as possible. But he finds the luxurious
cabin of the Semiramis much to his liking, and he smokes
and dreams of “Cuba Libre” while the Semiramis steams
down the bay and out upon the bosom of the Atlantic,
and when he goes on deck, wrapped in the long semi-military
cloak which effectually conceals his person, the
sight which greets his eyes fills him with apprehension,
though challenging his liveliest interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The battle of steam is well under way. The America
is less than a dozen lengths astern and presents a beautiful
sight to the people on the Semiramis. The glistening
white hull plows the water at a speed which dashes
the spray high in air from the delicately carved cut-water,
and the triple funnels vomit great clouds of inky
smoke. Manada’s eyes rove to the United States flag
whipping out in the breeze and he mutters a favorite
malediction as he thinks of the insurgent arms stored in
the hold of the Semiramis.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as he grows aware that the yacht of his strange
friend is drawing away from the American man-of-war
he becomes the incarnation of suppressed excitement.
And when Van Zandt claps him on the shoulder and
shouts in his ear, “Well, senor, what do you think of the
Semiramis?” the Cuban shouts back enthusiastically:
“El Semiramis es un diablo verdadero!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without the change of a muscle in his weather-beaten
face, Capt. Sam Beals paces the bridge of the Semiramis,
while the exciting duel of steam and steel continues,
not a gesture or ejaculation indicating that the beautiful
yacht is literally steaming away from the cruiser—a vessel
heralded far and wide as the speediest craft among all
the navies of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the chief officer is apparently undisturbed, the
same cannot be said of any other person on board. The
excitement of the race has roused the owner of the yacht
from his cold reserve, and as with sparkling eye and eager
step he hurries from the engine-room to the quarterdeck,
noting with each return the slowly but steadily lengthening
space of open water that separates the two vessels,
Louise Hathaway mentally retracts her decision that
Phillip Van Zandt is cold and unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Miss Hathaway herself, she is thoroughly imbued
with the spirit of the race. Securely sheltered
from the fierce rush of wind which the tremendous speed
of the Semiramis causes to sweep over the deck, she
makes an attractive picture as she watches the race. The
svelte form is outlined in a gown of navy blue; the
beautiful face is framed in a golden aureole of wavy locks;
the matchless blue eyes glisten with unwonted excitement,
and a delicate color tints her cheek. It is not
strange that Van Zandt divides his time between the race
and his fair passenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even pale, stern-faced Cyrus Felton has for the nonce
became stirred by the infectious excitement, and with a
zest that he has not manifested for years he watches the
unavailing efforts of the warship to overhaul the pleasure
craft.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t there more and blacker smoke pouring from the
America’s stacks?” inquires Miss Hathaway, as the owner
of the Semiramis returns from a brief interview with the
engineer, with the cheery assurance that the engines are
running as smoothly as if the yacht were moving at
quarter-speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is surely making more smoke and, if I mistake
not, more speed,” answers Van Zandt, a shade of anxiety
replacing his almost boyish enthusiasm. “Mr. Beals,
what think you of it?” turning to the executive officer;
“is she gaining on us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has just put on her forced draught, sir, and is
now running at her top speed. She is gaining, now,
but—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without finishing the sentence the captain presses the
electric bells which communicate with the engine-room.
It is soon apparent that the yacht has not until now
reached the limit of her speed. The regular vibrations
that mark the revolutions of the twin shafts become one
prolonged shiver, and the black hull is hurled through
the water at incredible speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The effect becomes noticeable in short order. The
white mass astern grows “fine by degrees and beautifully
less,” and as Capt. Beals closes his glass with a snap he
remarks, complacently: “She’ll be hull down in an hour
or two if she doesn’t blow out a cylinder head before that
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just about this time Van Zandt and Manada go below
and reappear a few moments later with a closely rolled
silken flag, which Van Zandt hands to the captain with
the command that it be hoisted to the breeze. Without
even examining the emblem, the imperturbable executive
officer bends the silken roll upon the halyards. A few
hearty pulls by a stalwart blue-jacket and the ensign
reaches the masthead, where the stiff breeze quickly
breaks it out.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a singular flag, with a solitary star in a triangular
field of blue, is revealed to the wondering gaze of passengers
and crew, Don Manada reverently bares his
head and his lips frame the words “Viva Cuba Libre!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly there is borne to their ears, above the whistling
of the wind and the mighty pulsations of the machinery,
the sullen boom of cannon. All eyes instinctively
seek the America. A puff of white issues from her
forward barbette, and as Capt. Beals returns his glass
to its socket, he tells Van Zandt:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has saluted the Semiramis and dipped her ensign.
She is bearing off to windward and gives up the race.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She saw the flag, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doubtless,” Mr. Beals replies, with a grim smile.
“Shall we slacken speed, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only to natural draught. I wish to make our destination
as soon as possible. And by the way, Mr. Beals,
you may haul down the flag. It has served its purpose
for the present,” pointing to the enraptured Don Manada.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Van Zandt conducts his passengers below and is
prepared for Miss Hathaway’s question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that your personal emblem, Mr. Van Zandt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Miss Hathaway,” is the calm response. “That
is the flag of the Cuban Republic. You are now under
the protection of the provisional government of the gem
of the Antilles. Permit me to introduce to you Don
Rafael Manada, minister of war of the infant republic.
Long may she wave!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada bows low and looks vastly gratified by the
official title jestingly conferred upon him. Cyrus Felton’s
face, however, is darkened by a frown and Miss Hathaway
is not at all pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you not take seats and make yourselves entirely
easy?” Van Zandt proceeds, unruffled by the cold demeanor
of his passengers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I should have told you before you embarked,”
explains Van Zandt, with a glance at Miss Hathaway
that does much toward reassuring her, “that although we
are bound for Cuba, our primary destination is not Santiago.
The Semiramis has a cargo of arms and ammunition
which I have undertaken to deliver to the Cuban
revolutionists. Senor Manada is the supercargo. Believe
me,” he adds, as Miss Hathaway pales at the word
“revolutionists,” “there is absolutely no danger, not the
slightest—and least of all to you. Even if my yacht were
apprehended—though I do not believe there is a vessel
on the waters of the globe that can overtake her—you
would be subject to no annoyance and but little inconvenience.
After we have discharged our cargo we will
proceed at once to Santiago, and you will be landed much
earlier than if you had gone by a regular steamer. And
I am sure this vessel is fully as comfortable as any of
those stuffy, crowded craft.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we are aboard a filibustering expedition,” declares
Mr. Felton, harshly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly that. You are on board an American yacht,
manned by American seamen, with just one Cuban
patriot, a man as honorable and true as yourself, Mr.
Felton.” Van Zandt’s voice is stern and dignified. “I am
not a Cuban partisan, but liberty to me is as precious as
the air of heaven. Until a few hours ago there was no
thought of the cargo now beneath us. The arms were
designed to go by another vessel. But at the last moment
the plans of the patriots were betrayed. Then it was that
I stepped in and offered the services of my yacht to
convey the much-needed aid to the down-trodden men of
the Antilles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And meanwhile you have jeopardized the safety of
Miss Hathaway and myself,” Mr. Felton sneers. “Suppose
we are intercepted by a Spanish warship? Think
you that they will not regard us—myself at least—as
members of this expedition? What then, Mr. Van
Zandt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter’s lip curls slightly. “Again I assure you that
there is absolutely no danger. I will answer for your
safety on this voyage with my life.” Then to Louise,
with a look that brings a flush to her fair face: “Have
you no faith in the yacht, if not in her owner, Miss
Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think that Mr. Felton is needlessly alarmed,” is that
young lady’s composed reply. “As for the yacht, I am
quite carried away with it, figuratively as well as literally.
This is my first voyage, Mr. Van Zandt, and if you will
insure me against mal de mer, that dread bugbear of the
voyageur, I will try to brave, with becoming equanimity,
the perils of the Spanish main.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton, however, is decidedly alarmed by Van
Zandt’s admission of the incidental errand of the Semiramis.
A strong distrust of her owner begins to grow
in his mind; this added to the qualms of seasickness,
which have begun to make themselves felt, renders him
thoroughly miserable in spirit and body, and without raising
another objection he asks to be shown to his stateroom.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must be confessed that Van Zandt does not manifest
heartfelt regret at Mr. Felton’s unhappy condition, and
even Miss Hathaway is somewhat perfunctory in her
expressions of sympathy. An unaccountable confidence
in the handsome owner of the Semiramis has replaced
her early distrust, and, happily exempt from the “dread
bugbear of the voyageur,” she accepts with pleasure Van
Zandt’s proposition that they explore the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Semiramis is fair to look upon, from capstan to
rudder, and from keelson to main truck. The Vermont
maiden marvels at the comfort, convenience and luxury
on every hand. The palatial saloon, with its unusually
high ceiling, furnished in oriental magnificence and including
a superb upright piano, Miss Hathaway’s eye
notes approvingly; the commodious staterooms, arranged
en suite, with the respectable appearing stewardess in
charge; the plain but ample and scrupulously neat quarters
of the crew; the engine-room, with its masses of highly
polished steel and brass—all possess elements of interest
to the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night, as she lays her head on her pillow, “rocked
in the cradle of the deep,” she suddenly starts as if from a
dream. For there comes to her ears again, from somewhere,
that melody strangely sweet, yet filled with subtle
melancholy, the andante of her beloved sonata.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a light goes up, as the Germans have the saying,
and Miss Hathaway understands now her blindly placed
confidence in the master of the Semiramis. For Don
Caesar de Bazan is Phillip Van Zandt and—and—</p>

<p class='c011'>But what Miss Hathaway thinks about as Atlantic’s
waves lull her to slumber would certainly interest the
young man who sits up far into the night, chatting and
smoking with the “minister of war of the Cuban republic”
while the Semiramis rushes on her eventful voyage to
the tropics.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE FLAG OF CASTILE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Twelve hours from now, Miss Hathaway, you will
have your first glimpse of Cuba. Then, our business
transacted, a quick and uninterrupted run to Santiago,
and to-morrow you will be on terra firma.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It has been a remarkably short voyage, Mr. Van
Zandt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deplorably so. I never before regretted the speed
of the Semiramis, but now—would that she were as snail-like
as the old West Indian tub we overhauled yesterday.
Can I prevail upon you, Miss Hathaway, to again favor
me with my pet Chopin nocturne? The electric fans render
the saloon as comfortable as the deck.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My poor playing is always at your service, Mr. Van
Zandt. I assure you that I never expected to enjoy a
voyage, to Cuba or elsewhere, as I have this. Your kindness
in granting us—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My kindness was purely selfish,” interposes Van
Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is easy to see that for two people on board the yacht
the last few days have swiftly sped. Van Zandt and Miss
Hathaway have been much in each other’s company.
Confidences have been neither asked nor given, but a
mutual sympathy has taken root that might prove destructive
to the reserve of one and the “marble” of the
other were the voyage to the tropics to last many days
longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton is restricted to his stateroom most of the
time, a victim of the malady of the sea and a gnawing,
indefinable distrust of the owner of the yacht. As for
Don Manada, he divides his attention between the huge
cigars from which his fingers or teeth are never free, and
a careful outlook for any of the Spanish squadron that is
supposed to blockade the coast of the isle of Cuba.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the sensuous indolence of the tropic day and the
glories of the tropic night lure Van Zandt and Miss
Hathaway into dreams of peace and hope and fulfillment.
The days spent on the quarterdeck, sheltered by an awning
from the rays of the sun, the speed of the yacht providing
a delightful breeze, glide gently into the brief twilight.
The great stars shoot out of the blue with quivering
points of fire, and the wind sighs musically through
the rigging as the tireless steam drives the boat through
the phosphorescent waves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Consider what the voyage would have been to me
without your presence,” continues Van Zandt, as he leads
the way to the saloon. “With Don Manada there, engrossed
in Quixotic schemes for achieving the independence
of his beloved country, and Capt. Beals as communicative
as a sphinx, your society has saved me from myself—a
synonym for dreariness. And now for the nocturne.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While Van Zandt is telling Miss Hathaway that she is
the only woman he has ever heard play Chopin intelligently,
and the latter is modestly disclaiming such ability,
the musical echo of the lookout’s call is passed to the
saloon:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where away?” is the challenge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the weather bow. A large steamer, judging from
her smoke!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Manada casts his cherished cigar to the waves and
glues his eyes to the telescope.</p>

<p class='c011'>As announced, the unknown vessel is directly on the
weather bow and will pass within half a mile of the Semiramis,
if the two craft hold to their present courses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The captain intently watches the approaching vessel.
The Semiramis is far beyond the five-mile limit of the
Cuban coast, but if the unknown is a Spanish cruiser
she may become suspicious of the trim yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>It therefore behooves the American steamer to insure
the stranger a wide berth if the latter displays the arms of
Castile; to show a clean pair of heels, in the vernacular
of the sailor, if flight is necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again are preparations made to force the Semiramis
to her highest speed. The awnings are removed, the
boats once more unswung from the davits, the force of
stokers in the engine-room augmented by half a score
of sturdy seamen, and soon the roaring of the forced
draught in the funnels again drowns the hum of the engines.</p>

<p class='c011'>At rail or in rigging, from bridge or quarterdeck the
people of the Semiramis watch intently the approaching
vessel, whose funnels and upper works are now visible
through the glass.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Semiramis bears gradually to the westward, to afford
the stranger at least three miles leeway. Suddenly
Capt. Beals lays aside his glasses and rubs his chin
thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you care to show your papers to the Don?” he
asks Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the Don? Is she a Spaniard, sure? But we shall
pass a comfortable distance to windward of her and she
will not attempt to interrupt us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has already changed her course and is bearing
directly across our bows. See!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The unknown, now less than ten miles distant, seems
to be steaming at full speed for a point directly in the
course of the Semiramis. Her broadside is now visible
to the anxious watchers on the yacht. She is apparently
an armored cruiser of perhaps 5,000 tons, her hull painted
a dull and featureless gray. No flag or emblem is as yet
displayed from her taut and business-like rigging.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is painted and cleared for action. She is—ah! I
thought so!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A flag is broken from the cruiser’s masthead, and Capt.
Beals, as he focuses his binocular upon the streaming emblem,
mutters between his teeth: “The flag of Castile!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis a Spanish warship, Senor Van Zandt!” exclaims
Manada, who has been studying the stranger. “Can
your beautiful craft bear us from harm’s way? I fear
that yonder ship is the Infanta Isabel, the latest and most
formidable accession to the navy of our hated oppressors.
She has been detailed to intercept vessels supposed to
bear arms and re-enforcements to our friends, and especially
to watch for and destroy our gallant Pearl of the
Antilles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have no fears, Don Manada. Your cargo is safe.
We will show the Spaniard a trick or two; eh, Beals?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals does not reply in words to his employer’s
confident assertion, but an observant man might distinguish
a slight relaxation of the muscles about his mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Semiramis holds steadily on her course. Only the
increasing clouds of smoke that pour from her funnels
indicate that anything out of the ordinary is expected of
the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only six miles distant! Five! Four!</p>

<p class='c011'>A puff of white that rolls lazily from the forward deck
of the cruiser is succeeded by a dull roar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Show the Don our colors,” Capt. Beals orders the
second officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the smoke from the cannon yet lingers above
the Spaniard’s deck the glorious stars and stripes unfurl
from the mainmast of the Semiramis, and snap gayly,
defiantly, upon the breeze. And still the American yacht
continues to steadily lessen the distance that separates the
two craft.</p>

<p class='c011'>Boom!</p>

<p class='c011'>Another puff of white, followed a few seconds later by
the report; and this time the watchers on the yacht can
see the flash of the gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only two miles distant now, and the Spanish warship,
apparently convinced that the American understands and
designs to obey the peremptory summons to heave to, has
slowed her engines until the cruiser has barely headway
on the long swells.</p>

<p class='c011'>Calmly pacing the bridge, as if a thousand miles separated
the vessels—nearly equal in size, but how dissimilar
in destructive power!—Capt. Beals has not indicated a
slowing of the yacht’s engines, although the bow of the
Semiramis points at the steep side of the Spaniard, directly
amidship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not half a dozen lengths away!</p>

<p class='c011'>The officers and men on the man-of-war are clearly
visible to those on the yacht. The captain and his subalterns
are grouped on the quarterdeck, the marines
amidship, the blue-jackets crowding the rail and adjacent
rigging. The cruiser is stationary on the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>But with no sensible diminution of speed the Semiramis
bears upon the Spaniard, the white foam dashing high
on either side of her bow. Capt. Beals is fingering the
electric buttons that regulate the speed and course of the
yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish captain nearly drops his speaking trumpet.
What is El Americano thinking of? He cannot
stop in five times his own length at such a frightful speed!
Is he mad? Ah! Dios! Caramba! And a dozen
more Castilian expletives poured forth in a torrent of astonishment,
rage and chagrin.</p>

<p class='c011'>For with a sudden turn to the windward that causes
the yacht to careen until her white sides below the water
line gleam for an instant in the sunlight, with an accession
of speed that sends her forward as a whip would a
nervous horse, the Semiramis darts by the stern of the
Spanish man-of-war, the smoke from her furnaces enveloping
for a moment the cruiser’s afterdeck.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two minutes later she is a mile astern of the warship,
her long white trail sparkling in the sunlight, and the
red, white and blue still snapping defiantly at the masthead.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if the Don can turn in five times his own
length,” observes the sententious Mr. Beals, as he watches
the warship slowly getting under way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether he can or cannot is not at this time to be
demonstrated. The cruiser makes no attempt to about
ship, but another report booms from the forward gun,
followed a second or two later by one from the aft barbette,
and a solid shot ricochets along the waves astern
of the Semiramis and plunges beneath the water an eighth
of a mile distant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt grows grave as he realizes the significance
of this last shot, but a glance at the receding cruiser convinces
him of the futility of the cannonade. The Spaniard,
too, appears convinced, and the cruiser is soon lost
to view in the expanse of ocean.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rest of the day the Semiramis holds unmolested
her course for the mountain-girth shores of Cuba. As
night draws on the engines are slowed, and, with fires
banked and double watch posted, the yacht quietly rocks
on the bosom of the deep. A wavy outline on the horizon
indicates the southern coast of the revolution-racked isle
and somewhere on that outline is the sequestered little
harbor of Cantero.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a weary, an unnerving vigil, for Don Manada at
least. For hours his anxious gaze sweeps the horizon,
while the Semiramis rides the breasting waves as gracefully
as a summer bird soars into the blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the first shafts of light radiate from the emerging
disk, Louise Hathaway, whom the unwonted excitement
of the preceding day has driven early from her pillow,
cries out with a girlish enthusiasm that brings a smile
to the face of Capt. Beals: “Sail ho! Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one springs to rail or rigging. “Where away?”
is the quick challenge of Mr. Beals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right there, sir,” is the unnautical response of Miss
Hathaway, and she indicates a point not five degrees
north of the rising orb of day.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the glass at his eyes, the taciturn commander of
the Semiramis watches intently the speck on the glowing
horizon that means much to the excited Manada at his
elbow and to the latter’s struggling fellow-patriots on the
isle whose outlines are now bathed in the flood of sunlight.</p>

<p class='c011'>Is it another Spanish warship, or is it the looked-for
Cuban cruiser, the doughty Pearl of the Antilles?</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>AN AFFRONT AND AN APOLOGY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The Semiramis rests stationary upon the surface of
the water, but there are scenes of activity in the engine-room.
The columns of smoke from her stacks grow into
thick black volumes, and the roar of escaping steam
drowns ordinary conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>On deck, officers, passengers and crew are watching
the rapidly growing spot upon the horizon. That the approaching
vessel is steaming very fast is apparent. Her
upper works are visible as Capt. Beals signals for the
Semiramis to steam ahead at full speed. The course of
the latter is laid to pass the stranger a mile or two to
windward, if she does not change her present course.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Manada has possessed himself of the captain’s
glasses and is earnestly scanning the distant steamer.
Suddenly, in a very paroxyism of joy he embraces the
owner of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the Pearl!” he cries; “the Pearl of the Antilles!
Santisima! Now will you display the flag of Cuba Libre?”
The English language fails to express the sentiments
of the Cuban patriot at this juncture, and he
launches a flood of Castilian that bewilders Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>At a nod from the latter, however, Capt. Beals causes
the fateful emblem of Cuba to be run up to the masthead.
The silken banner is barely unfurled by the wind ere
there are signs of excitement on board the strange steamship.
A duplicate of the Semiramis’ ensign is displayed,
and then the course of the vessel is changed and she
steams rapidly toward the yacht. Don Manada is not
mistaken. The steamship is the famous Pearl of the Antilles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Semiramis has slowed down her engines, and
awaits the approach of the insurgent cruiser. As the latter
nears the yacht the resemblance of the two steamships
becomes more striking. The Pearl is almost precisely
the length of the Semiramis, and like her is rigged with
two masts. Her two smokestacks are set at the same angle
as those of the yacht and like the latter she is equipped
with twin propellers. On deck, however, there is a decided
difference. The engines of the Pearl are protected
by heavy plates of steel, while on her forward deck a
sort of turret has been improvised, within which, the
people on the Semiramis can readily guess, is the famous
“Yankee gun,” the dynamite cannon whose well-aimed
projectile sent the Spanish Mercedes to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Five lengths away the Pearl becomes stationary on the
waves, while through a speaking tube, the voluble Manada
acquaints her commander with the character and
mission of the yacht. A boat is lowered from the insurgent
craft and is rowed to the side of the Semiramis,
and a moment later a distinguished-looking man in the
undress uniform of an officer of the Spanish navy is
clasped in the arms of Don Manada.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senor Van Zandt,” the latter says, “permit me to present
to you Capt. Gerardo Nunez, the commander of
yonder vessel. Senor Van Zandt,” he explains extravagantly
to Capt. Nunez, “is the good angel who rendered
it possible for us to convey the much-needed arms and
ammunition in our hold to our struggling compatriots.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Nunez cordially grasps the hand of Van Zandt.
“Senor,” he says, “I am more than pleased to meet you,
and join with Don Manada in expressing the gratitude
of our people for your services in the cause of liberty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt waves his hand. “’Tis nothing. My sympathies
are with the insurgents and being in position to
help Don Manada out of a box”—the Cuban flushes at
the recollection of his last conversation with Mrs. Harding—“I
was only too glad to do it. But what is the
latest news from the seat of war?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Nunez’ eyes light up with enthusiasm. “Glorious!”
he says. “Gen. Masso has just achieved a victory
over 3,000 Spanish troops in the Puerto Principe District.
El Terredo is receiving constant additions to his forces
and the outlook was never brighter. It is to equip El
Terredo’s army that these arms and ammunition will be
used.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“El Terredo?” inquires Van Zandt. “Is he not attached
to the Pearl of the Antilles?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has been up to within a week, but is now on
shore duty. By the way, senor,” remarks the Cuban
commander, casting a glance over the deck of the Semiramis,
“you have a magnificent yacht, and I doubt not
she is as speedy as she is handsome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speedy!” breaks in Don Manada. “She is as swift as
the wind! She sailed away from the America, the fastest
cruiser in the United States Navy, and as for the Infanta
Isabel—poof! She snaps her fingers at her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals approaches the group at this moment and
is introduced to the Cuban captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think, sir,” he says to Van Zandt, “if we are to
transfer our cargo it would be advisable to waste no
time. There is no knowing when a Spanish gunboat will
show up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This advice is manifestly so timely that no time is lost
in following it. The two hulls are laid side by side, the
smoothness of the water permitting the operation in
safety and hundreds of brawny arms are quickly at work
transferring the cargo from the Semiramis to the Pearl.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the work is completed and Van Zandt looks
inquiringly at Don Manada.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you continue with the yacht or accompany the
cargo on board the Pearl?” he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cuban emissary hesitates. “If I might add to the
already heavy debt of gratitude I owe you—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s all right,” interrupts Van Zandt. “So
you will remain with us. I am glad of your company.
We sail for Santiago and afterward”—he hesitates a
moment, his eyes wandering to Miss Hathaway, who is
watching curiously the motley crew of the Pearl—“well,
eventually back to New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada nods gratefully. “I am of more service to the
cause in America than I could possibly be in Cuba,” he
says, apologetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>The adieus are said, the lines cast off, and the Semiramis
and Pearl move slowly apart. The latter shapes
her coarse for the little harbor of Cantero, where the arms
and ammunition are to be landed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are but ten hours’ sail from Santiago, Miss Hathaway,”
Van Zandt remarks, as Louise idly watches the
rapidly disappearing Pearl. “Then you will bid adieu to
the Semiramis.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Regretfully, indeed, Mr. Van Zandt. The last few
days have sped all too quickly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘We take no heed of time but by its flight,’” quotes
Van Zandt. “How long do you expect to remain in
Cuba?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Louise turns a troubled face toward the owner of the
yacht. “That I cannot say. It depends upon Mr. Felton.
He has business interests to look after, and if the climate
agrees with him we may remain several months.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a silence for a little, the thoughts of both
dwelling on the coming parting at even.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hathaway,” says Van Zandt, suddenly. “I am
but an idle fellow, with nothing to call me hence but my
own inclinations. Would it be distasteful to you if I
should attach myself to your party while in Cuba? The
country is necessarily unsettled during the war and perhaps
I might be of service. I am familiar with the
Spanish language, which I believe Mr. Felton is not,
and I should like to see something of the country. Please
tell me frankly if for any reason I would be de trop?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt’s luminous orbs are fixed on the fair face of
Louise as he awaits the answer to his question. For a
moment her blue eyes return his gaze. Then the golden-fringed
lids fall and a soft blush mantles her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I certainly should not be averse to your joining our
party,” she murmurs softly, “if—if it be your pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” Van Zandt returns, simply, and a moment
after Miss Hathaway retires to her stateroom.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Manada,” remarks Van Zandt, slapping the
Cuban upon the back, “your first engagement as supercargo
must be rated a success, eh? The arms and ammunition—the
biggest single consignment ever sent from
the States, I think you said—have been safely delivered
into the hands of the insurgents, without the loss of a
single Winchester or cartridge. Why this pensive look?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only thoughts of the past, senor. I was—”</p>

<p class='c011'>What were Don Manada’s thoughts will never be known,
for the people on the yacht are electrified by the hail
from the bridge, “Ship ahoy!” followed a second later by
the additional information, “Dead ahead and bearing
this way!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no special necessity for evading her now,
whoever she is, I presume, sir?” inquires Capt. Beals,
removing his glasses from his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None whatever,” is Van Zandt’s prompt reply. “Our
papers are straight and we have nothing contraband,
unless it be the Don there. Let them look us over if
they wish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s not a very large craft,” comments the taciturn
executive officer of the yacht, as the two vessels continue
to lessen the distance between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably one of the blockading fleet,” is Van Zandt’s
surmise.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is evidently right, for the stranger at this point
displays the Spanish flag and at the same time the report
of a cannon echoes across the water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Show our colors,” orders Van Zandt, and the flag of
the great republic is caressed by the soft southern breeze.
Another shot is fired from the Spaniard, and as the Semiramis
slows up a third cloud of white floats from the side
of the war vessel, followed by the sudden boom of a
heavier gun.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the Semiramis steams slowly toward the Spaniard,
now distant less than a mile, a fourth report is heard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shotted, by heaven!” ejaculates Capt. Beals, his eyes
glued to the glass; “and the Don has changed her course
and is standing off to pepper us. He is one of those tin-clad
gunboats, only half our tonnage, and pays no attention
to our flag.” Still another shot is fired, and a solid
shot skips over the waves, barely two lengths astern of
the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we ram him, sir? We can send him to Davy
Jones’ locker in ten minutes, and not harm the yacht,
either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt’s eyes glance aloft at the Stars and Stripes
standing out clear and free from the maintop, and then
his eyes turn to the Spanish gunboat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Steam toward him full speed,” he says at length, “and
if he fires on the American flag again”—the white teeth
shut with an ominous click—“ram him full amidship, let
the consequences be what they may.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the flag is not fired upon again. The Spaniard has
once more laid a new course and is now bearing down full
on the yacht. The two craft are quickly within hailing
distance, and from the gunboat comes the inquiry in
Spanish as to the name and character of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Semiramis, pleasure craft, New York for Santiago,”
is Capt. Beals’ reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish captain is profuse in apologies for firing
on the yacht. She closely resembles a rebel craft, he
explains, and the gunboat was sure she was that vessel,
even if she did fly the American flag. Would the Semiramis
accept his most humble apologies? His gunboat,
La Pinta, was about to proceed to Santiago for orders;
and if it please los Americanos they might sail thither in
company, which would insure the stranger against the
annoyance of being overhauled by some of the other
numerous Spanish vessels blockading the ports.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt consults with Capt. Beals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He wants to make sure we don’t land anything,” remarks
the latter. “It might save some trouble to accompany
him to Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, the Spaniard is informed, the American accepts
the apology and the escort of the gunboat to Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the brief southern twilight has drifted into night
the Semiramis is lying at anchor in the harbor of Santiago,
under the guns of the Spanish gunboat La Pinta.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t get the idea, I see,” remarks Ashley. “Well,
let me think. ‘Huevos’ means eggs, I know that much,
but what the deuce is soft-boiled? I believe ‘blondo’ is
soft, and soft eggs might express the idea. ‘Blondo
huevos,’” he tells the waiter, and the latter, though apparently
puzzled, disappears.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the next ten minutes Jack is occupied in receiving
and sending back orders of eggs—eggs cooked in every
conceivable style except soft-boiled. Finally in despair
he selects a dish nearest to his wants, and gets along all
right until he decides to have some chicken. An examination
of the bill of fare fails to discover anything that
looks like chicken, and the case appears hopeless.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I only had my phrase book with me I might do
some business,” he reflects. “As it is, I don’t see any
way out of it except to draw a picture of a chicken. Hold
on; ‘gallina’ means hen, unless I have forgotten my
studies, and if there is anything consistent in the linguistic
diminutives of the Spanish language, ‘gallinoso’ must be
the equivalent for chicken.” So he orders “gallinoso”
with a complacence born of a problem happily solved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The waiter simply stares and waits patiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Gallinoso’ doesn’t go, then.” Ashley looks the bill
of fare over again. The most attractive item is “salchichas
con aroz,” but he does not dare risk that. Finally a
happy thought occurs to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Todos!” he orders. “Todos! Todos!” The waiter,
with a grin of intelligence, hurries away and Ashley
heaves a sigh of relief. “Great word, ‘todos,’” he soliloquizes.
“Most significant word in the language.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is effective, at least, for the waiter arrives with a
little of everything that the kitchen affords and Ashley
manages to make out a meal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile he has noticed that his efforts at Spanish
have vastly entertained a gentleman who sits at the table
beyond and facing him. Particularly broad was his smile
when the order for “gallinoso” was given. As Jack leisurely
sorts out the most appetizing-looking of the array
of greasy viands, he remarks: “If you were as hungry as
I, senor, my attempts to secure a breakfast might strike
you as being more tragic than humorous.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant no offense,” replies the senor. “You would
yourself smile if you knew what ‘gallinoso’ is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? What may it be, an octopus or a mule?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost as bad as either. It is a turkey buzzard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes; they were probably just out of turkey buzzards.
Oh, well, I’ll get the hang of the language before
I leave Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Undoubtedly. It is easy of acquisition. You have,
I assume, provided yourself with a phrase-book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A magnificent affair. It contains every possible
phrase except the ones I have occasion to use.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two finish their repast about the same time, and as
they stroll out upon the veranda to enjoy the long, strong
cigar that inevitably follows a Cuban breakfast the senor
remarks:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are an American, I judge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“New York,” is the terse response.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you been in Cuba long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About two hours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? I was not aware that any steamers arrived
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because of the blockade, eh? But I dropped in on
the cruiser America.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are of the service?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I am just a plain American citizen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, senor, this is hardly a desirable time for Americans
or others to visit Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An eminently proper time for one in my line of business,”
replies Ashley. “I am a newspaper correspondent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The senor looks the young man over critically. “Your
profession is not regarded with especial favor at present
by the Spanish Government,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I understand so,” drawls Ashley. “Newspaper men
have an unpleasant habit of stating facts, something the
government is not particularly anxious to have abroad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A flush of annoyance mounts the senor’s face, and on
the left cheek Ashley for the first time notices a small,
crescent-shaped scar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aha!” he thinks. “This gentleman rather answers
my friend Barker’s description of the party who left New
York with the fair Mrs. Harding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Government has no desire to conceal facts,” asserts
the senor, with some warmth, “but it naturally seeks
to prevent the dissemination of false, exaggerated or
malicious reports. What journal do you represent,
senor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley tenders his card. The senor glances at it and
smiles half-derisively. “The Hemisphere! I had that
very journal in mind,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My paper must be excused from feeling flattered,
then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was only a week or so ago,” continues the senor,
“that I read in your paper a sensational interview with a
visionary enthusiast, which was a little more exaggerated
and absurd than the average.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was before you left New York, probably,” ventures
Ashley, and the senor shoots a glance at him from
a pair of keen black eyes. “You refer to the interview
with Don Manada,” goes on Ashley. “I had the pleasure
of placing the distinguished Cuban’s views before the
public.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not surprised,” comments the senor, with quiet
sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In other words you consider me a man who would
deliberately put forth false, exaggerated or malicious reports.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not say so, senor. I presume you are typical of
your profession.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I believe I am. Our journal, like every other
decent paper, prints the news. If it were to investigate
every dispatch that comes to it day by day there would
be precious little information for the reader who turns
to it each morning. If an injustice is occasionally done,
the paper is ever willing to rectify its error and make all
proper amends. You must naturally expect the American
newspapers to favor the dispatches received from insurgent
sources.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, pray?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the reason that little dependence can be placed
upon the statements of the opposition. In fact,” smiles
Ashley, “the situation approximates somewhat the condition
intimated in a joke now going the rounds of the
press. A Spanish captain in surrendering to superior
numbers or prowess, craves one boon at the hands of his
conqueror. ‘What is it?’ asks the latter. ‘Please announce
the fact,’ requests the Spanish captain, ‘that I
have won an overwhelming victory.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The senor fails to see anything amusing in the jest.
“Do you intend to remain at Santiago?” he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the present. The fighting appears to be principally
at this end of the island. Later I may push on to
Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There has been more than one instance of expulsion
of foreign correspondents, senor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I am told. Well, I shall do my duty, as well as I
know how. I naturally sympathize with the Cubans,
but I shall not permit my sympathies to lead me to color
any reports of the war’s progress. If a battle occurs to-morrow
and the government forces are victorious, the
simple facts in the case will be forwarded, without further
comment than is required to make the story interesting.
And if the Cubans win, the same impartiality will characterize
my dispatch. I expect the same fair play that I
extend. Is that not reasonable?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, at any rate, I like your frankness,” says the
senor, with something approaching good humor. “I also
like America and admire its people. Do your duty as
you understand it, Senor Ashley, and should your zeal as
a correspondent lead you into difficulty perhaps I may be
of service to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” acknowledges Jack. “But with my
present limited means of identifying you, I should be
more likely to be garroted or shot before I could send
you word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The senor smiles. “I am Gen. Murillo,” he says.
“Adios, Senor Ashley.” And with a courtly bow the
Spanish gentleman takes himself off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So,” muses Ashley, looking after the retreating figure.
“Gen. Juan Murillo, the chief of staff attached to the
captain-general, is the patron of the beautiful Harding.
I remember the Hemisphere noted his presence in New
York. My lady’s services must be booked for something
out of the ordinary spy business. Murillo is in Santiago;
so probably is she, but if this city is her base of operations
she is likely to sail pretty close to the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, where on earth is Barker?” wonders Ashley.
“Probably at the other end of the island, while the objects
of his quest are at this end. The Semiramis rests
serenely on the bosom of the bay, and Miss Hathaway and
Messrs. Felton and Van Zandt are either aboard of her
or are somewhere about the city. I believe I’ll go out
to the yacht and settle the question in my mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he does. He is rowed out over the blazing sea
by a sun-cured barquero and climbs to the deck of the
Semiramis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Van Zandt?” repeats Capt. Beals, in response to
Ashley’s inquiry. “Left yesterday, sir: Where? Havana,
I believe the destination was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And his passengers?” ventures Ashley. “I am a friend
of theirs,” he explains to Mr. Beals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His passengers went with him,” the latter tells him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is about to return to shore when he hears an
exclamation and he sees coming toward him Don Rafael
Manada, the distinguished member of the Cuban revolutionary
society.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dios mio! Senor Ashley, I am delighted to see you,”
exclaims the volatile Manada, embracing him warmly.
“What brings you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Business, my dear Don Manada, I am at present
officiating as a war correspondent. Will you not come
ashore and take dinner with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A thousand thanks, Senor Ashley; but,” with a smile
intended to be significant, “I believe it would be wise for
me to remain here for the present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way,” says Ashley, “you recollect that interview
at the Fifth Avenue hotel a week or so ago?”
Manada nods smilingly. “Well, I met a gentleman to-day
who spoke rather slightingly of the views which you
therein expressed. Perhaps you know him. Gen. Murillo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Murillo!” cries the Cuban. “Ha! Is he in Santiago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was he alone? That is, was he not accompanied—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the fair Mrs. Harding?” supplies Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada’s face flushes. “Ah, you know her?” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Slightly,” returns Jack. “No; Mrs. Harding was not
with the general, though she may be in the neighborhood.
They left New York together. Now, Don Manada, having
imparted some information to you, I should esteem it
a great favor if you would reciprocate.” Ashley glances
about and notices that they are out of hearing. “I will
not ask you why you happen to be on the Semiramis, as
I have no disposition to pry into your affairs, but I
should like to know how Mr. Felton and Miss Hathaway
came to be aboard of the yacht?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada shrugs his shoulders. “I have not an idea,”
he says. “An hour before the Semiramis sailed they were
driven to the pier in company with the owner of the
yacht. Where they came from I cannot say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did they appear to be well acquainted with one another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very nearly strangers, I should say. Senor Felton
kept his stateroom during nearly all the voyage and
seemed to avoid Senor Van Zandt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is now getting some information of decided
interest. “And Miss Hathaway? Did she appear to
share the distrust or dislike?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite the contrary. They were together about all the
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Don Manada, there is one query I should like
to put to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come,” smiles Manada, “I can guess what your question
is to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will save you the trouble and ask it. As a man of
years and experience, of keen discernment and calm
conclusions, what should you say were the precise relations
existing between Phillip Van Zandt and Louise
Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Manada appears to reflect deeply. Then he says, with a
gravity belied by the twinkle in his eyes: “Serious, my
dear Senor Ashley; very serious.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” responds Ashley. “Well, I believe I’ll
go ashore and get better acquainted with the natives. I
hope to see you again, Don Manada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall probably be here until the yacht leaves, senor.
Adios.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley is borne shoreward he digests the information
extracted from his Cuban friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So far as Miss Hathaway’s tender regard is concerned,
I appear to be a rank outsider,” he soliloquizes.
“But I have the consolation of knowing that I did not
permit myself to fall in love with her. Rather a melancholy
consolation, but philosophy was invented for just
such cases as this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Van Zandt. Well, Barker can doubt as much
as he pleases, but I will stake my reputation as a soothsayer
that Van Zandt and Ernest Stanley are one and
the same man. And if Phillip Van Zandt is not a
Nemesis, stalking on the trail of his prospective victim
or victims, then I am indeed a prophet unworthy of honor
in ‘mine ain countree’ or in the world at large.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A CAFE QUARREL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“I suppose this is the Madison Square of Santiago,”
remarks Jack Ashley, as he notes approvingly the brilliant
spectacle which the plaza affords, now that the tropic
night is atoning for the enervating heat of the tropic
afternoon. Santiago, like all Cuban cities, wakes up
measurably early, bustles about for three hours or so, and
then dozes or fans itself until the sun drops into the sea
and night comes with scarcely a shadow of twilight.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Santiago wakes again with a start, and for a
few more hours laughs and chatters, promenades and
flirts until about 10 o’clock, when the curtain falls, not to
rise again until the sun is well up the morning sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nightly gathering on the plaza has been tersely
described as “a scene of shoulders, arms, trains, jewels
and cascarilla.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The women monopolize the plaza and the men the
cafe, the latter a simple interior, a mere loafing-place for
the Cuban, whose capacities as an idler are the result of
many years’ practice in the gentle art of doing nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Into one of the cafés that border the panorama of
gayety strolls Ashley. The place is crowded, but over in
the farthest corner he sees a table at which only one
person is seated. Toward this he threads his way, but
when almost there his progress is impeded by a party of
four who are taking up more space than the law of
equality allows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon me,” remarks Jack, as he brushes past the
chair of an unamiable-appearing individual in undress
military attire. The latter moves reluctantly and growls
something which Ashley suspects is not complimentary,
and as he drops into a seat he asks the gentleman across
the table: “Do you speak English, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Occasionally,” is the brief rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then would you oblige me by translating the remark
of the chap whose repose I just disturbed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s of no consequence,” replies the other. “An impertinence
upon Americans. The feeling against that
people is very bitter in Santiago just now. The United
States is suspected of encouraging practically as well as
morally the present insurrection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I had better go over and punch his head,”
observes Ashley. “His suspicions might be better
grounded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would be a waste of time and perhaps lead to a
general row. He is only a Spanish captain who has invested
his title with more importance than would suffice
for the entire service. Spanish captains are as plentiful
as Kentucky colonels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak by the card,” laughs Ashley, as he orders
a glass of jerez and a cigar. “Your English, too, is as
pure as a New Yorker’s—or perhaps I should say as un-foreign.
Pure English is not a drug in the New York
market.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have resided in New York, as well as other parts
of the United States. But after a short residence on this
island a man drifts into the indolence and shiftlessness of
the natives and loses much of his identity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He does not lose his Americanism, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; the same thrill comes over him when he sees the
most beautiful of all flags streaming out on the breeze,
and with it is increased his sense of the outrageous
wrongs which the Cuban has suffered from generation to
generation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has been looking his acquaintance over with
much interest, and the result of his “sizing up” is as
follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>Age, about Ashley’s own; above the medium height,
athletic of build, and straight as the proverbial arrow;
general air denoting decision, dash, and a bit of
recklessness. His garments are dark and somewhat
travel-worn, and on his head, pulled down well
over his eyes, he wears a soft hat that borders on the
sombrero.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just now he is scowling at the party of four near by,
who are making merry apparently at the expense of the
two young men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As I said before,” observes Ashley, “if you will kindly
translate the remarks of yonder chaps it will afford me
considerable satisfaction to call them to order. Ah, if
I could only tell them in Spanish what I think of them
in English,” he adds, recollecting an old opera-bouffe
jest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s acquaintance is evidently making an effort to
keep his temper, but his resentment is apparent in the
flash of his eyes and the red spot in each cheek.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove!” suddenly reflects Ashley, “perhaps our
military friend understands English. I’ll try him.” Then
to the apparent leading spirit of the quartet, who has just
delivered himself of a sally that vastly amuses his companions,
Ashley leans over and drawls: “Pardon me,
senor, am I the subject of your mirth?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spaniard may understand, but he makes no sign.
The quartet set down their glasses and stare at the self-possessed
young man who has risen and walked to their
table and whose mild blue eyes run over the party in
calm inquiry. And the young man notes that the time-killers
for many tables around have ceased their chatter
for the moment and are watching curiously the progress
of the colloquy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have reason to suspect,” goes on Ashley, “that you
are making a beastly nuisance of yourself, and unless you
are anxious for a good American thrashing I would
advise you to keep a civil tongue from now on. If you
don’t understand that I’ll knock it through your head in
short order.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The reply is a volley of red-hot Castilian, but Ashley
is saved the trouble of attempting to comprehend it. For
at this moment a long arm reaches by him and the
Spanish captain is dealt a slap across the mouth that
transforms his teeth for an instant into castanets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there is confusion. The quartet spring to their
feet and one of them seizes a bottle. But Ashley grips
the uplifted arm with a wrist of steel and remarks in tones
that carry conviction: “Easy, my friend, or I’ll throw you
through the side of the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The idlers in the cafe crowd about the combatants and
the proprietor rushes up and protests against the disorder.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish captain and Ashley’s friend glare at each
other, and the latter, after pronouncing the words “Hotel
Royal” with a significance appreciated by his antagonist,
slips his arm through Ashley’s and draws him from the
cafe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whither?” queries Jack, as they proceed down the
street.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the Hotel Royal. I am stopping there for the
night. And you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Same cheerful hostelry. Is it the worst in Cuba?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The worst and the best. They are all off the same
piece.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you come up to my room?” asks he of the black
eyes, when the hotel is reached. “We shall doubtless be
waited upon presently.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By our Spanish friend?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By his representative, more likely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how is he to locate you?” questions Ashley. “No
pasteboards were exchanged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His companion smiles sardonically. “Capt. Raymon
Huerta and I are not strangers,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even as he speaks there is a rap at the door and as it
is thrown open in strides one of the Spanish quartet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Senor Cardena,” says the young man with the
black eyes, glancing at the bit of pasteboard in his hand,
“what is your pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, Senor Navarro, you may expect,” replies Cardena,
declining stiffly the proffered chair. “Capt. Huerta
demands satisfaction for the insult offered to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not only offered, but delivered,” mutters Ashley, and
he returns in kind Cardena’s impertinent glance. “So
my unknown friend’s name is Navarro,” he thinks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may convey to Capt. Huerta my willingness to
afford him the desired redress,” says Navarro. “How
will sunrise, on the beach below the city, answer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am authorized to make the necessary arrangements.
What you have proposed will be satisfactory. And the
weapons?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pistols, I suppose; I am provided with one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on,” puts in Ashley. “I have just the article.
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.” Repairing to his
room he extracts from his trunk two superb Smith &amp;
Wesson 38-caliber revolvers, and these he submits to
Cardena and Navarro. Senor Cardena professes himself
to be satisfied with the weapons and, with a perfunctory
“Adios,” he withdraws.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he has gone Navarro tosses his arms impatiently
and murmurs: “What a fool I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All men are or have been at some period,” Ashley assures
him. “But what gives rise to your present self-accusation?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The thought that I permitted my temper to play the
mischief with my judgment,” is the gloomy reply. “A
man has the right to risk his own life, but not the life, or
what is dearer than life, of those whose interests he is
intrusted with.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“See here,” Ashley gently protests, “if there is any
fighting to be done why not let me have the job? I
began the row—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I finished it. No, my friend, this affair must go
on to the bitter end. Although, as you rightly suspected,
you were the ostensible object of the remarks of the party
at the cafe, they were in reality directed toward me. It
was inevitable that Capt. Huerta and I should cross,
though I might have to-night avoided a meeting which
would better be left to the future. May I request you to
second me in the meeting?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Assuredly, Senor Navarro. That is your name, I
judge?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; Emilio Navarro—quite Spanish, you see,” with
a peculiar smile. “And your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack Ashley; residence, New York; occupation, newspaper
man; paper, the Hemisphere; ever heard of it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The newspaper is not a stranger to me. Pardon me
a few minutes,” says Navarro, and he occupies himself
in writing a somewhat lengthy letter, which he seals,
without addressing, and hands to Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ashley, you are a man of honor,” he says, laying one
hand upon the newspaper man’s shoulder. “Promise me
that if anything happens to me to-morrow you will deliver
that letter to a name I will whisper to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall do so with profound regret, sir. The name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Manuel de Quesada. He resides in the Pueblo
de Olivet, on the edge of Santos, four miles west of
Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley places the letter in his pocket. “I will not fail
you, if the occasion for my services should arise. But
unless Huerta is more familiar with the American revolver
than I believe him to be, I shall have the happiness
of returning this document to you after you have filled
him full of leaden satisfaction. How are you on the shoot,
anyway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro smiles grimly. “I have hit a playing card at
fifty yards,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well; that’s close enough marksmanship. I am
beginning to feel sorry for Huerta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Save your sympathy. I shall not kill him. And now,
friend Ashley, I believe I’ll go to bed. I have been riding
all day and I am as tired as a dog. At daylight we start.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At daylight it is. It is not too late to accept my offer
to exchange places with you. I can’t hit a playing card
at fifty yards, but at least I am alone in the world, and,
barring a few excellent friends, would not be especially
missed. It is as much my quarrel as yours, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Ashley,” says Navarro, with much emotion,
“I am deeply sensible of the goodness of heart that
prompts your offer, but, I repeat, this affair must proceed
as it has begun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, good-night to you, then,” says Ashley, and he
goes off to bed, wondering what manner of man is he
who speaks of a thrill at the sight of the most beautiful
of all flags streaming out upon the breeze, and yet claims
the distinctly Spanish name of Emilio Navarro.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>JUANITA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The sun is creeping up the range of hills when Ashley
and Navarro leave the Hotel Royal and set forth at a
smart pace for the meeting with Capt. Raymon Huerta.
Ashley is in his usual good spirits, and the enlivening
influence of his society is appreciated by Navarro, whose
thoughts are plainly of a dejected nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half a mile or more down the beach that stretches east
of the city three men are in waiting. Two of them are
Capt. Huerta and Senor Cardena; the third is evidently
a surgeon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The preliminaries for the exchange of shots are quickly
arranged. Ashley, with the fifty-yards range in mind,
proposes the comfortable distance of twenty-five paces,
and Cardena assents. Then the revolvers are handed out
and carefully scrutinized, and Huerta and Navarro face
each other on the sands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How’s your nerve, old man?” Ashley asks Navarro,
as he gives the latter’s hand an encouraging squeeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Steady,” is the response, in low tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember the letter,” admonishes Navarro, and as
Ashley nods and steps back the duelists signal that they
are ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>A minute later two shots startle into flight a flock of
sea gulls that have been hovering along the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the echoes Capt. Huerta staggers and is immediately
taken in charge by the watchful Cardena and
the medico.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not scratched, eh?” Ashley inquires of Navarro.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; but the lead passed close enough for comfort.
Unless my aim was poor, Huerta is not seriously hurt.
To have killed him would have been to invite serious
entanglement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor is the Spanish captain in any immediate danger
of parting with existence. The bullet has plowed through
the right shoulder, causing a ragged wound and a great
flow of blood, but a few days will put him on his feet
again, the surgeon reports to Cardena. Wounded honor
is satisfied by the physical wound, and after a brief announcement
of this fact and a stiff “Adios” the Spaniards
drive away, and Navarro and his American friend are left
upon the beach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Any trouble with the authorities likely?” Ashley
queries, as the two turn cityward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not. Huerta is a thorough-paced scoundrel,
but he has never been accused of being a coward or an
informer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A great change has come over Navarro. His eye is
bright and his step elastic and he tells Ashley, as they
stride along in the cool air of the morning, that he is
terribly hungry and would appreciate a good breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>As good a meal as Cuba affords is forthcoming, and as
Ashley suddenly recollects the now happily unnecessary
letter to Don Quesada, Navarro tears it into fragments
and says abruptly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ashley, amigo, have you ever seen the Pearl of the
Antilles?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I haven’t been in Santiago quite twenty-four
hours yet. You mean the insurgent cruiser?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, no; I mean the most beautiful girl in Cuba. She
is the daughter of Don Manuel de Quesada, and is at
once the joy and the despair of half the unmarried
jeunesse doree of Santiago. Would you like to meet
her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By all means. Next to a good horse and a trim yacht,
I know of nothing that interests me more than a beautiful
woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. I am going out to La Quinta de Quesada.
Hunt up a horse and accompany me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro is already provided with a steed, a magnificent
black animal that interests Ashley far more than the prospects
of the acquaintance of the Pearl of the Antilles.
“Came into my possession yesterday,” Navarro tells him.
“Isn’t he a beauty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is that,” is Jack’s appreciative reply. “If you run
across his mate put me in the way of acquiring him and
I will do my war correspondence in the saddle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley succeeds in chartering a fairly presentable beast
for the day, and the two young men set out for Santos
in the best of spirits. They are in no hurry and the ride
of something over four miles through El Valle de Bosque
Cillos, the wooded valley, occupies an hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through Santos, which is one of the smallest
of villages, embracing only a jail, a church and a score
of dwellings, the travelers take the road to La Quinta de
Quesada, which is located in the center of the Pueblo de
Olivet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Quinta is a square, two-storied affair and the
principal material in its construction is coral stone. The
inevitable and grateful veranda stretches around three
sides and an air of quiet luxury is evident in the spacious
house and its attractive surroundings.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Navarro and Ashley ride slowly up the shaded carriage
way and turn suddenly in sight of the quinta, the
first objects that greet Jack’s vision are two young people
in one of the hammocks on the veranda. A young man’s
arm encircles a young lady’s waist and the attitude of the
pair suggests either the relations of lovers or of brother
and sister. They start up in some confusion upon the
advent of a stranger and come forward to greet Navarro.
When the latter dismounts the young man embraces him
warmly and Navarro, as he rests one arm affectionately
about the youth’s shoulders, says to Ashley: “My
younger brother, Don Carlos.” Then he turns to the
young lady:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Juanita, I want you to know my friend, Senor Jack
Ashley of New York. Senor Ashley, La Senorita de
Quesada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has slid from his horse and his acknowledgment
of the introduction is rather less debonair than
usual; because, as he confesses afterward to himself, he
is somewhat confused by the beauty of the young woman,
who gives him her hand and tells him that the quinta
has no friends more welcome than Don Emilio.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here is an outline of Juanita de Quesada, the Pearl
of the Antilles, as sketched rapidly but indelibly upon the
tablets of Jack Ashley’s memory:</p>

<p class='c011'>She is 20 or thereabouts, and is considerably below the
medium height. The proportions of her slender yet full
form are as perfect as nature ever molds. Her face is
oval, and her complexion a soft, creamy olive. Evidences
of her race are in the lead-black hair, the dark,
dreamy eyes of liquid fire, the rather large, tremulous
mouth, with its scarlet lips, and the completing perfection
of Cuban loveliness, the dainty little feet with the incomparable
arches. All Cuban women are not beautiful, but
as Ashley looks upon the present picture he decides that
the imperfections of her sisters are amply compensated
for by the dazzling loveliness of the Senorita de Quesada.
“She is glorious,” he thinks; and then: “I wonder if she
knows anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hardly less striking, though dissimilar in character, is
the beauty of Don Carlos Navarro. He is a slender
youth, with dark-brown eyes and curly hair, and if it were
not for the effeminacy of his regular features he would
receive the critical approval of the New Yorker. As it
is, Ashley confesses that Juanita and Don Carlos are the
handsomest young pair he ever set eyes upon, and he
wonders what may be the relationship existing between
them. For Carlos is no more Spanish in appearance than
his brother Emilio.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Don Quesada?” asks Navarro, when the
party have disposed themselves upon the veranda.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With his books and papers, as usual,” replies Carlos,
with a significant glance at his brother. “Come, I will
take you to him. He will be overjoyed to greet you. It
is nearly two weeks, Emilio, since we last saw you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it may be much longer than two weeks ere you
see me again,” says Navarro, as he follows Carlos into the
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley finds himself vastly interested in the young lady
with whom he has been left tete-a-tete. He learns that
she has not a near relative save her father (Carlos must
then be her lover); that she is no stranger to the United
States, having resided in New York two years; that she
loves America and everything American; that, were it
not that her father’s interests necessitated a residence in
Cuba, she would like to live always in America; and
much more information, imparted in a quiet, dignified
manner which Jack is positive was acquired by her short
stay in the land of the free and the home of the enterprising.</p>

<p class='c011'>All too soon comes the interruption of luncheon, and
Ashley is presented to Don Manuel de Quesada. Jack
takes a good, square look at the tall, spare, elderly man
who grasps his hand warmly and tells him that he is
always proud and happy to meet an American.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Quesada is a typical Cuban in appearance; his
bearing is distinguished and his manner partakes of the
dignity and repose of his daughter. But there is a certain
weakness about the mouth that Ashley at once notes.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, Don Quesada is cordiality itself, and after
lunch the three men adjourn to the library for a smoke,
Carlos and Juanita taking themselves off for a ramble
through the park.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conversation drifts naturally to a discussion of the
patriotic uprising which has almost attained the proportions
of a revolution that promises to be as successful as
the struggle for independence of the American colonists.
The talk is general, and Ashley surprises his companions
by remarking abruptly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, Don Quesada, before I left America it
was hinted to me by an influential member of the Cuban
revolutionary society that the President of the Provisional
Republic of Cuba is a resident of Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah?” says Quesada, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is, I suppose Santos may be considered a part of
Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quesada and Navarro look at each other meaningly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In other words, that this President is none other than
yourself, Don Quesada,” continues Ashley; and without
waiting for a reply to this direct speech he goes on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you only what, as I say, was intimated to me in
the strictest confidence. I shall not ask for a confirmation
or a contradiction; I am not thinking of interviewing
you. I am an American and the representative of an
American newspaper. As such, I am supposed, while in
Cuba, to maintain a neutrality. I had intended, before I
met Don Navarro, to call upon you in a professional
capacity, but now I find myself your guest. It is for you
to say what is your pleasure in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Quesada studies keenly the face of the war correspondent,
but reads only sincerity in the frank blue eyes.
Then he looks at Navarro and the latter extends his hand
to Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ashley, I believe we understand one another,” he says.
“There is no need of further explanations. If there is
any interviewing to be done, you can operate on me.
I believe Don Quesada will willingly allow me to submit
to the ordeal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be merciful,” smiles Ashley. “But before I proceed
further, permit me to present the vouchers for my
discretion and reliability,” and he passes over a letter
which relieves Don Quesada of any possible distrust
of his acquaintance of a few hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is late in the afternoon when Navarro announces that
he must depart. Ashley is courteously invited to enjoy
for as long a time as he may care to the hospitality of the
quinta, but duty demands his presence at Santiago until
he gets his affairs into shape. However, he promises to
call frequently while he is in this part of the country, a
pledge he anticipates much pleasure in fulfilling. And as
he rides away with Navarro his usually cool head is
disturbed by speculations as to the probable relations
between Don Carlos Navarro and Juanita de Quesada.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, Navarro,” he says, suddenly to his companion,
“is there any likelihood of my ever chancing
upon El Terredo, the mysterious revolutionary leader
whom we were discussing this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly,” is the reply. The travelers have reached
a fork in the road, about half-way between Santos and
Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My path lies yonder,” says Navarro, pointing to the
north. “We must part here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, take care of yourself,” remarks Ashley, gripping
the extended hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro rides slowly away, but he has not gone five
yards when he checks his horse and turns in his saddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like to see El Terredo?” he asks, with a
smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would satisfy my curiosity,” is Ashley’s prompt
response.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, my friend, take your first look, and the last for
many days, if not forever. For I am El Terredo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Waving his hat with a graceful sweep Navarro rides
away to the mountains.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>ONE WAY TO GET TO CUBA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Whew!” For the nineteenth time John Barker gives
utterance to the expressive exclamation, as he mops his
perspiring forehead.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective is seated in the parlor car of the Florida
express, which has just left Jacksonville, and is being
whirled along toward Tampa Bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>He soon indulges in a nap, while the train rumbles on,
by the scattered negro huts, with their ebon-hued occupants
drawn up in solemn array to watch the flying cars,
through the dense forests of moss-entwined trees, across
the trestle-spanned marshes and mud-colored rivers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker is dreaming of a hand-to-hand encounter with
Cyrus Felton, wherein the latter has succeeded in clasping
the handcuffs about his (Barker’s) neck and is slowly
but surely rendering futile his breathing apparatus, when
the porter’s voice calling out “Tampa Bay” recalls him to
his senses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The single hotel at Tampa Bay, Barker subsequently
finds, is not a half-bad institution, judged by the midnight
inspection, and ascertaining from the clerk that the
steamer for Key West does not sail until 3 o’clock the following
afternoon, the detective retires in the confident
belief that he has overtaken Mrs. Harding at least.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker is right in his surmise. He has nearly finished
his breakfast the next morning, when the striking figure
of Mrs. Harding enters the dining-room and is escorted
by the obsequious waiter to the table at which the detective
is seated. The latter lingers long over his coffee
and muffins, while he improves the opportunity of studying
his vis-a-vis.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Handsome as a queen,” is his conclusion, as the glorious
black eyes glance idly into his. But there is a tinge
of melancholy in her face, a preoccupation in her manner,
that does not escape the observation of the detective,
and at which he wonders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot be that the military chap has given her the
go-by,” he thinks.</p>

<p class='c011'>He has not, for at this moment the soldierly form of
the Spaniard enters the room and he is directed to a seat
beside Mrs. Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing very lover-like in their greeting,” ruminates
Barker, as the two exchange salutations. “Since they are
to be fellow-passengers on the boat to Key West and
Havana I will postpone my interview until then.” Barker
strolls out upon the hotel veranda.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long does it take to run to Havana?” he inquires,
casually, of the porter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“About a ten hours’ sail from Key West, when the
steamers are running,” he is told.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When the steamers are running? Are they not running
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; they run only as far as Key West now, since
the blockade was declared.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker paces slowly up and down the veranda.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I must be hoodooed,” he mutters; “that does
settle it. Here I’ve raced 1,700 miles to head off my
game, only to be foiled by a measly blockade. I can’t
stand it to charter a ship, and it looks mightily as if Cyrus
Felton was going to slip through my hands. But how are
my lady and the Spanish-looking chap to get there? I
will go to Key West at any rate. There may be some
way to cross the channel from there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective is not in cheerful spirits as he boards
the steamer, but he feels a shade of satisfaction while
noting Mrs. Harding and her cavalier ascend the gang-plank
just before the signal for departure is given.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will have a little tete-a-tete by and by, my lady,”
he murmurs. But, greatly to the detective’s disappointment,
Mrs. Harding does not emerge from her stateroom
until the steamer has sighted the yellow stretch of sand
that marks the entrance to the harbor of Key West.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we shall either be fellow-voyagers again, or ‘on
a tropical isle we’ll sit and smile,’” reflects Barker, philosophically.</p>

<p class='c011'>Determined that he will not lose sight of the charming
Mrs. Harding again, Barker loiters about the steamer
until she trips across the gang-plank, the last passenger
to disembark. Her traveling companion has preceded
her nearly half an hour, and Barker wonders again if they
have parted company. Their baggage, he observes, is
still on the pier, and even as Mrs. Harding steps ashore
Barker sees the Spaniard coming rapidly toward her.
He conducts her to the opposite side of the wharf, where
is moored a neat little steam launch, manned by a number
of sailors in the uniform of the Spanish navy. The
baggage upon which Barker’s watchful eyes are fixed is
quickly conveyed aboard the launch, Mrs. Harding follows,
still escorted by the military-appearing stranger,
and a moment later the little craft shoots out from
the dock and makes for a man-of-war lying at anchor in
the harbor and flying the Spanish colors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Barker’s last opportunity for a tete-a-tete with
“my lady” has vanished.</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective watches the launch until it vanishes behind
the bow of the warship, but words fail utterly to
express his feelings. He mechanically picks up his grip
and suffers himself to be conducted by an enterprising
Bahaman to the American hotel, picturesquely surrounded
by tropical shrubs and plants.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Barker,” the detective communes with himself,
“it looks decidedly as if my lady possessed a slight advantage
in having a man-of-war at her call. But with all that
fleet of boats in the harbor it does seem that there should
be one bound for Cuba. How to hit that particular one
is the question.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He strolls down the broad street to the harbor front,
and from a wharf wistfully gazes at the Spanish man-of-war
now nearly hull down on the horizon bearing away
his fair fellow-voyager. A tanned and weather-beaten son
of Neptune is making fast a small sloop, whose name
Barker notes with idle curiosity is emblazoned in generous
letters on her stern, “Cayo Hueso.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say, my good fellow,” he says, “you don’t happen to
know of any way to reach Havana, do you? Are any of
these vessels likely to sail for that port within a day or
two?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He of the weather-beaten face finishes making fast the
little sloop without answering, and then slowly turns and
looks at Barker. The gaze is a long and searching one,
but apparently it is satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one way to reach Cuba, I reckon,” he says,
with a pronounced nasal twang. “That is, if you are
sailor enough to stand that sloop and wise enough to
keep your mouth shut on occasions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker surveys the little craft doubtfully. She is of
perhaps five tons’ burden, and looks old and risky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could stand the sail if the boat is seaworthy, and I
am anxious to reach Havana,” he finally says. “When do
you sail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At 6 o’clock. The Cayo don’t go clear to Cuba, only
about half-way across the channel. But we can put you
aboard another craft that will land you in Havana. Got
any baggage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker meditates a moment. “How long will it take
to make the passage?” he inquires.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wall, if this wind holds you ought to be in Havana
by to-morrow night. It will cost you—say, $25.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker’s decision is made. “I’ll chance it,” he says.
“I’ll be here at 6 o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On his return to the Cayo Hueso, the detective finds
the crew of three already aboard and his sailor friend
preparing to cast off. He ruefully surveys the small craft
and thinks of the 120-mile trip, but there is no alternative
and he clambers aboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the sails are hoisted Barker is amazed by the rate
at which the little craft speeds out of the harbor. There is
always a breeze on the keys, the captain of the Cayo tells
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the sea begins to growl a bit and Barker does not
like it. As the breeze freshens, the commotion beneath
his vest increases.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just the kind of a breeze for a run across, eh?” remarks
the man at the tiller, with a voice that sounds to
Barker like the rasp of a new saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dunno,” replies the detective, whose face is rapidly
becoming “sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the little vessel continues to spin over the waters,
as darkness settles upon the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stars are paling in the heavens and the gray dawn
is creeping athwart the sloop, when Barker awakens from
a troubled nap and struggles into a sitting posture. He
sees only the bare horizon, the ocean lying black and
leaden and wrinkled like an old man’s face. There is no
boat in sight, he thinks; they are not yet half-way to the
Cuban shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there is a boat in sight. Hull down to the east,
imperceptible to his untrained eye, a delicate pearl shaft
hangs like a pendant just on the horizon. For a time it
seems dim and visionary; then even Barker, did he possess
sufficient ambition to lift his head again, could see a
duplicate of the sloop lazily crawling toward her, and,
within half an hour, come alongside the Cayo Hueso.</p>

<p class='c011'>At once certain mysterious boxes and casks, chiefly the
latter, are transferred from one boat to the other. Then
Barker laboriously and disconsolately steps from the
Cayo Hueso to the strange boat, while his weather-beaten
friend communes with the captain of the latter. His destination
is a matter of supremest indifference to the detective.
He manfully strives to hold up his head while
the exchange of salutations is made, fails and sinks
passively into the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun is gilding Maro castle as the little craft enters
the harbor of Havana.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A remarkably quick passage,” says the captain in
Spanish, as the sloop is being moored to a dilapidated
wharf in an obscure portion of the water front.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker struggles to his feet. “Are we in Havana?” he
inquires in Spanish, a trifle rusty, but still intelligible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Si, senor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank heaven!” is the pious ejaculation of the detective.
“I’ll live and die in Cuba before I’ll every trust
myself in a cockleshell like that again.”</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'>“Heavens! They have just sized up my condition and
sent an ambulance,” Barker grunts, as his eyes rest for
the first time on that marvel of vehicular construction, a
Cuban volante, which the good-natured captain of the
sloop has secured for his late passenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>But before he clambers into the conveyance the detective,
whose professional instincts are now awakening,
ascertains from the driver that the American steamer
City of Havana has not yet arrived, although due that
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker begins to feel better. “Things seem to be
coming my way at last,” he thinks complacently. “I’ll
take no chances this time. John Barker, detective, will be
the first to greet Cyrus Felton when that gentleman steps
on Cuban soil. Now for the hotel and a bath, a visit to
the American consul and then to the wharf of the Red
Star Line, wherever that is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a very different individual from the woebegone
passenger on the little smuggler that three hours later
lounges about the dimly lighted freight sheds of the
American Steamship Line, awaiting the arrival of the
overdue vessel. “Richard’s himself again,” he remarks;
“or will be when his long-neglected appetite is appeased.
I hope the City of Havana will not keep me up all night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The night wears on—the longest, Barker assures himself,
with one exception, that he ever knew, and the sun
is well above the horizon ere his heart is cheered by the
boom of a cannon on Moro castle, announcing the arrival
of a foreign vessel. It is the American liner, and by the
time the various custom officers, summoned by the signal
gun, have arrived on the wharf, the steamer is being
moored to the pier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker has taken a position where he can command a
view of the gang-plank, and with a grim smile he awaits
the disembarking of the passengers. There are not many.
A few Havana business men, a score or two of Cubans,
three or four Spanish officers and half a dozen Americans
cross the plank, and then there is a lull in the procession.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker’s smile fades and there is a suspicion of anxiety
in his expression as the tall, slim form of Cyrus Felton
does not appear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps he is sick,” the detective thinks. “I will go
aboard and inquire of the purser.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No; there was no passenger on this trip named Felton,
that officer states, running his eye down the rather abbreviated
passenger list.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker stares vacantly at the purser. Rapidly there
passes through his mind the circumstances preceding his
interesting journey to Havana—the departure of Felton
and Miss Hathaway from the St. James; his (Barker’s)
hurried trip to Key West; the unavailing effort to interview
Mrs. Harding; the voyage in the smuggler to Havana;
last night’s long and weary vigil.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Felton did not sail on the City of Havana after all!</p>

<p class='c011'>Without a word of thanks to the courteous purser, the
detective slowly turns and retraces his steps. He walks
aimlessly from the wharf, his disappointment for the time
being too bitter for expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>But John Barker, whatever his errors of judgment, is
a clear-minded, persistent man, and after a half-hour’s
walk in the enervating atmosphere of a Havana midday
he pulls himself up with a start.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he says as he wipes the perspiration from his
face, “I’m euchred this time, it appears, and must make
the best of it. But this is the deciding trick, and by
heaven,” the detective grinds his teeth, “I will track Cyrus
Felton down if it takes the rest of my life! I have it!
I’ll see if the son, Ralph Felton, is actually here, as Ashley
believes. If he is, I will at least have something to show
for my trip to this awfully hot hole. Now for something
to eat at the grand hotel Pasaje, if I can find the way.
It’s mighty lucky I know some Spanish.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shadows are lengthening toward night when
Barker awakens from the sound slumber into which his
“siesta” after a comfortable meal has developed. He is
feeling greatly refreshed and ready to pick up again the
tangled threads of the trail that he has followed so far.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now for a little stroll about the city, to see what the
place is like,” he thinks, as he lights a cigar and saunters
down the broad street.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later, Barker has strayed farther from the
hotel than he realizes and has unwittingly penetrated into
the most disreputable quarter of Havana. For a brief
rest he enters a cafe, and seating himself at a table in a
corner of a room orders a light drink, absent-mindedly
speaking in English.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two dark-browed, yellow-skinned Cubans, who have
been conversing earnestly in low tones at a table adjoining
Barker’s, glower at the newcomer, but as he gives his
order to the waiter in English they resume their interrupted
conversation. Barker idly sips his jerez and wonders
what Jack Ashley will say on receiving the letter he
left for him in New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly the word “Americano,” hissed by one of the
two Cubans, arrests his attention and he strains his ears
to hear in what connection the word was used. The pair
are talking in low tones, but the detective’s trained sense
is able to comprehend the tenor of the conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cubans are discussing the assassination of some
person, an American, and presumably that American is
John Barker!</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective slips his hand around to his hip pocket,
and as his fingers close over the butt of a 38-caliber pistol
his pulse resumes its calm and even beat and he proceeds
to make a mental inventory of the prospective assassins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Absolutely the most villainous-looking brace of cutthroats
I ever saw,” he sums up. “But why should they
plot to lay me out? Do they take me for a New York
millionaire in disguise, and think I carry a million or
two around in my pocket? Ah, so you were not the
distinguished individual picked out by the precious pair,
Barker. It’s some other American. But who? And how
can I manage to warn him of his danger?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker rapidly revolves the situation, while covertly
watching the Cubans. He suddenly starts, as from words
uttered by one of them, as they arise to leave the cafe, he
becomes aware that the cold-blooded crime planned
within his hearing is to be carried out within the next
hour or so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s nothing for me to do but to shadow the pair,”
he mutters, as he steps again into the now moonlit street.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a simple matter for the experienced detective to
keep the Cubans in sight, especially as they never once
take pains to glance backward. They have traversed
several streets, when the detective observes that they have
halted and are apparently loitering near a larger and
rather more elaborate cafe than the majority.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So the American is in that cafe,” reflects Barker;
“now, which is the better plan, to go in and endeavor to
pick out my fellow-countryman and warn him, or keep
in the rear of these chaps and swoop down on them at
the proper moment? The latter I guess is the safer.
We’ll see what we will see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The wait is not a long one. Evidently the Cubans are
familiar with the habits of the person they are seeking,
for within fifteen minutes a rather tall young man
emerges from the cafe, stopping a moment to light a
cigar, and then starts down the shadowy street. Barker,
after the first glance, pays little heed to the newcomer,
for his quick eye notes that he wears the undress uniform
of a Spanish officer. To his surprise, however, he perceives
that the two Cubans are stealthily following the
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it is not an American after all,” thinks Barker, as
he steals silently along. “But I can’t stand back and see a
human killed in cold blood, whatever his nationality, and
I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is nearly 10 o’clock now and the street is deserted.
As the form of the officer emerges into a clear patch of
moonlight, Barker perceives that the Cubans have narrowed
the distance that separates them from their prey,
and he hastens to close up the gap between himself and
the trio.</p>

<p class='c011'>He is not too soon. When less than two rods from the
Cubans he sees the flash of steel in the hand of the foremost
of the pair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look out!” Barker’s voice rings out in English, loud
and clear, and with the words he springs forward with a
speed that rivals his sprinting in his football days.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tackle low!” The whimsical thought flashes through
his brain as he clears the intervening space. And he
does. The nearest Cuban goes down with a bone-breaking
thud, the moonlight glitters for a second on something
bright in Barker’s hand, there is a sharp click, and
the detective springs to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there is no further need for his services. The other
Cuban is speeding like the wind down the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I owe you one for this, my friend,” says the cause of
the exciting episode in excellent English, as he strides up
to Barker and warmly presses his hand. “But for your
timely shout I should now be lying face downward there
with the stiletto ornamenting my back. But what have
you done to this scoundrel? He lies like a log.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’ll be all right in a few moments,” replies
Barker, carelessly glancing down at the prostrate figure.
“He went down so hard the wind was knocked out of
him. Then I handcuffed him. Are there any policemen
handy? If so, we can notify them and have him arrested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind the police. The soldiers will take care
of this cutthroat,” returns the other. “But come to my
quarters while I endeavor to express adequate thanks for
your service to-night. They are near by and I will send
a detail of men for this rascal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, never mind the thanks,” Barker replies carelessly.
“It was nothing. I happened to overhear the pair planning
to knife some one, and I followed to see the fun.
Only I must admit I thought from their talk that their
intended victim was one of my own countrymen, an
American.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I am, or was, by birth. But I am now an officer in
the Spanish army, Capt. Alvarez, of the staff of his excellency,
the captain-general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is as well that a fleecy cloud at the moment dims the
moonlight, for Barker, trained to control his emotions
though he is, cannot avoid a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez! the man beside him is Ralph Felton!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, here we are,” continues the self-expatriated American,
as he stops before a large mansion facing the plaza.
“Excuse me a moment while I send a man or two to look
after your handcuffed friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez hurries to the rear of the building and returning
shortly conducts Barker to a comfortably furnished
room on the first floor. “My sleeping-room,” he explains.
“Now, tell me how you happened to overhear that precious
pair planning to assassinate me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker briefly details the events leading up to the attack
on Alvarez, the latter listening with knitted brows,
but without comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now of yourself,” he says, when Barker has concluded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker hesitates a moment, the while studying the face
before him. “Cyrus Felton’s son, or his double” he
thinks. Then he takes a sudden resolution. “I am a
soldier of fortune,” he laughs. “I came down here to see
the country and a little fighting maybe. My name is
Parker; residence, the world. What are the chances for
a commission in the Spanish army?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly good for a commission. But”—Alvarez looks
Barker over shrewdly—“I should like to do you a service,
and may. What do you say to becoming my orderly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker’s eyes flash. He appears to deliberate for a
moment, and finally says: “I would like nothing better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good! To-morrow, then, will see you enrolled as a
soldier of Spain!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>ASHLEY TAKES THE FIELD.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The big, white moon that rolls through “heaven’s ebon
vault” and pales the glow of the southern cross looks
down upon two young people on the veranda of El
Quinta de Quesada. They have retired to the shadows
for purely healthful reasons, of course, as a baleful influence
is attributed to the direct rays of the tropic moon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You leave Santiago to-morrow?” asks Juanita, in
tones of real regret.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the first streak of daylight,” Ashley replies, lighting
the inevitable Cuban cigar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when shall we see you again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, quien sabe? I attack Spanish quite boldly now
you see. As a matter of fact, I have no definite idea as
to when I shall return. Sniffing the battle afar off has
become monotonous. I am impatient to hear the rattle
of musketry and the swish of the machete.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will not expose yourself!” cries the senorita.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley laughs softly. “I shall not lead any desperate
charges,” he says. “For my position demands a show of
neutrality, no matter how much I may sympathize at
heart with the patriots. There is fighting all along the
line between here and Havana, and I want a chance to
describe a Cuban battle from personal observation. Besides,
I like a good fight, and I shall probably itch to sail
in and help the under dog, if said dog happens to be on
the same side as my sympathies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But when such a chivalrous feeling seizes you,
restrain it; think of your friends, if not of yourself,” adjures
Juanita, gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, well, they would be the only mourners if I stopped
a Spanish bullet. I haven’t a relative in the world except
an amiable aunt in the western states, who threatens to
some day turn over to me the squandering of her small
fortune.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No relative except an aunt?” repeats Juanita, sympathetically.
“No one to weep for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the boys in the office would wear crepe for a
week, and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t talk so lightly on such a dreadful subject,” reproves
Juanita. “I am sure I should feel a great deal
more distress than ‘the boys in the office,’ and I have
known you only a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, senorita. You may feel sure that I shall
studiously avoid being borne off a Cuban battleground
upon my shield.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will keep on through to Havana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless circumstances bar my way, I shall follow along
the line of the railroad, stopping wherever night overtakes
me, and resuming my journey whenever I feel like
it. I have no definite plans. And, now, senorita, I believe
I will say Adios. It is getting along toward 9
o’clock, and the proprietary genius of my hotel looks
upon belated guests somewhat askance. I have made
my adieus to Don Manuel and Don Carlos, and it only
remains to express my regret at saying farewell to you,
senorita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita watches him while he untethers his horse, and
as he turns, bridle in hand, to lift his hat, she comes from
the veranda and puts her hand in his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will surely return?” she asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As surely as a bad penny.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will not say farewell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Au revoir it is, then,” says Jack. He lifts the little
hand to his lips, and then with rather unnecessary abruptness
he mounts his horse and rides away in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it!” he mutters, when out of sight of the quinta;
“that makes at least half a dozen times that I have pulled
myself together just in season to avoid making a fool of
myself. Perhaps my vigilance would be relaxed if I
could ascertain the precise relations existing between
Juanita and Carlos. I never saw two persons more
wrapped up in each other, and yet Juanita—” He
stops and repeats the name, dwelling upon each syllable.
“Pshaw! I believe I am getting soft in my head! G’lang,
old nag, or we won’t get to Santiago before midnight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the 5th of April. Ashley has been in Santiago
two weeks, and during the fortnight he has, in one way
or another, kept his paper well supplied with news. He
has also found many opportunities to run out to the
quinta, and the welcome has always been so warm, and
the adios so sincerely regretful, that he has begun to
wonder whether his interest in the beautiful daughter of
Don Manuel de Quesada is not lapping over the shadowy
line that separates friendship from a sentiment which
poets contend to be more powerful and philosophers regard
as infinitely weaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley has seen Murillo several times since his arrival,
and between the Spanish general and the newspaper man
something of friendship has grown. Murillo left for Havana
two days before, to join the captain-general, who, it
is reported, proposed to transfer his headquarters to Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Jack reaches his hotel he is informed that a
horse has been left for him at the stables.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For me?” he inquires in surprise, as he goes out and
looks upon a magnificent iron-gray beast fit for a king
on coronation day.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Senor Ashley, he is assured. It was brought during
the afternoon. Jack looks the acquisition over, and
then, turning to the trappings which hang near by, he
discovers a bit of paper attached to the saddle. On it is
written the single word “Navarro” and the mystery is
cleared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove! This is generous,” he says. “But I’m
blessed if I know where to send my thanks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dawn finds Ashley in the saddle and he makes quite a
brave appearance as he rides away. He is clad in a suit
of dark corduroy, with long riding boots and white-cloth
helmet and as he looks his costume over complacently
he remarks: “If my boots were a bit newer and shinier
I’d make a good running mate for the war correspondent
in ‘Michael Strogoff.’ It is a manifest libel to christen
this horse Rozinante,” patting affectionately the neck of
his sleek charger, “but as he is a Spanish steed he must
suffer from recollections of Cervantes. So Rozinante
it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the sun has become too aggressive to admit of
riding in comfort Ashley has covered some twenty miles
and has passed through two villages, wretched little settlements
that have ever existed in their present squalor for
generation upon generation. At the second of these he
stops for breakfast. The meal is no worse than he expected,
and after he has finished his coffee he hunts up a shady
spot on the outskirts of the town, and, hitching his horse,
he smokes and dozes until the late afternoon breezes from
the gulf suggest a resumption of his journey. At night
he tarries at the house of a farmer. They call them
“farmers” in Cuba. They burn charcoal, raise a few
vegetables and peddle milk and eggs.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day is very much like the first, except that
Ashley introduces the variation of sleeping all the afternoon
and riding the greater part of the night. And
when weariness finally overtakes him he camps on the
edge of a vast canefield.</p>

<p class='c011'>The third day is equally monotonous. He begins to
think that his expedition is to be utterly devoid of adventure.
He has seen no signs of either insurgents or
Spanish soldiery, nor have the natives along his route.
As evening approaches he rides into the decent-sized
town of Jibana, on the line of the railway between Havana
and Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhat to his surprise he learns that the only hotel
in the place is kept by an American. Landlord Carter
proves to be a decent sort of chap and his hostelry is
clean and inviting. After a really good supper Ashley
turns in early; he is thoroughly tired, having ridden
farther than on either of the previous days.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wakes moderately early and has a brief ante-breakfast
chat with Landlord Carter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have I heard of any fighting around here?” repeats
Carter, in response to Ashley’s inquiry. “No, but I expect
to see some most any day. There is a report that a
large number of insurgents are encamped in the mountains
within a score of miles of Jibana and the natives
hereabout are becoming restless. A rebel victory or two
would send the whole of this part of the province into
the insurgent fold. By the way, a party of three Americans
arrived last evening after you had gone to bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? What are they doing here and who are they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are going out to some sugar plantations near
here to-day. I haven’t learned their names yet, as—”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment the newspaper man hears a familiar
feminine voice exclaim in tones of the utmost astonishment.
“Why, Mr. Ashley!” and he turns to see Louise
Hathaway standing in the hotel doorway.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though somewhat dazed mentally, Jack lifts his hat
and remarks, as if he had seen her but yesterday, “Good-morning,
Miss Hathaway. You are an early riser.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You don’t appear a bit surprised to see me,” says the
young lady, as she gives him her hand; “while I am completely
bewildered at meeting an American friend in the
midst of this wilderness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, this is a very small world,” remarks Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, do tell me how you happen to be in Cuba. I
am dying with curiosity,” declares Louise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will explain in all haste. You should be able
to guess from my military bearing and the fierce aspect
which this helmet gives me that I am a war correspondent.
I have been in Cuba a little over a fortnight. I
arrived at Santiago three days after the Semiramis
dropped anchor and was told that you had gone to Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how did you know we sailed from New York on
the Semiramis? My note, left at the St. James hotel,
stated that we were going to Cuba on the steamship
City of Havana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. And I supposed that you had, until I saw
you on the deck of the Semiramis when the yacht was
running away from Uncle Sam’s cruiser off Sandy
Hook.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And now Miss Hathaway relates the effort which she
and Mr. Felton made to reach the pier before the City
of Havana sailed from New York. When she tells Ashley
of the adventure of the blockade on West Broadway
and of the subsequent appearance of Phillip Van Zandt
and his offer to place the Vermonters on Cuban soil,
Ashley twists his mustache reflectively.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway’s story is interrupted by the announcement
of breakfast, and five minutes later Ashley makes
one of a party of four at a table in the cozy dining-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton greets the newspaper man with grave
surprise, and Jack’s keen eyes note that the ex-president
of the Raymond national bank is looking bad. He is
paler even than when he saw him last, in New York
about a month ago, and in the gray eyes has settled an
expression of vague unrest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phillip Van Zandt acknowledges the introduction with
his accustomed reserve, and for an instant the eyes of the
two young men meet in a searching gaze of mutual inquiry.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the conversation that ensues, Ashley gathers
that most of the time which the trio have spent in Cuba
has been passed in and about Havana, and that they
are now en route to Santiago, stopping off at Jibana to
visit a sugar plantation in which Mr. Felton has an interest.
And, what is more to the point, Ashley learns that
the Semiramis is not to leave Santiago for at least another
fortnight. This information comes from Van Zandt.
Mr. Felton and Miss Hathaway do not appear to have
any definite plans.</p>

<p class='c011'>For his part, Ashley tells them that he intends to push
on to Havana, and knows not when he will return to
Santiago, if at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as he watches Mr. Felton, Van Zandt and Miss
Hathaway set forth, after breakfast, for the sugar plantation,
which lies east of the town, he tells himself that
he will return to Santiago before many days.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must keep my eye on those two gentlemen,” he
mutters, “and trust to Providence to throw Barker in
my way, if indeed he has not already struck the trail.
By the stars that shine, but there is a strangely assorted
trio, unless I am clear off my reckoning. Nemesis is
trailing his inevitable victim with said victim’s father,
and sooner or later they must meet. What is the town
beyond here?” Ashley asks Landlord Carter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cadoza,” the innkeeper informs him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I’ll jog along to that point, anyhow,” Jack
decides; “and if nothing turns up in the line of excitement
within twenty-four hours, then back to Santiago.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XL.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE APPEARANCE OF THE SERPENT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Half a dozen hours from the time that Jack Ashley
mounts his newly acquired Rozinante and rides forth
from Santiago on his journey into the west, a visitor
arrives at Le Quinta de Quesada.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Don and his daughter are seated on the veranda,
the former dreaming of the day when Cuba shall be free,
the latter of the blue-eyed young man who at the moment
is many miles on his journey toward Havana and is expressing
his opinion of Cuban roads in comical apostrophes,
rivaling the natural extravagance of Spanish
conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A visitor,” remarks Quesada, as the crunching of
carriage wheels sounds in the driveway, and Juanita’s
day dreams are abruptly terminated by the appearance
of a vehicle, not a Cuban every-day volante, but a four-wheeled
affair, the best that Santiago can provide.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carriage draws up before the quinta, the driver
opens the door with a profound obeisance, and out steps
a lady whose radiant beauty rather dazzles the Cuban
gentleman, who advances with easy grace to meet her.
For Don Quesada, though well past the meridian of life,
is not without susceptibility to feminine charms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have the pleasure of addressing Don Manuel de
Quesada, I believe?” says the fair visitor in English.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The pleasure is mine, madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am under the embarrassment of introducing myself,”
with a smile and a glance from a pair of liquid black
eyes that instantly win for her the good-will of the master
of the quinta. She tenders a bit of cardboard, and
as the Don receives it with a bow, she explains: “When
I left New York I had a letter of introduction from a
gentleman who has the honor of your acquaintance”—she
glances at the coachman standing near, and lowers
her voice—“Don Rafael Manada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” murmurs Quesada, regarding his visitor with
new interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I must have left it among my effects at Santiago.
I certainly have not lost it, as I was too thoroughly instructed
as to the importance of keeping its contents a
secret,” the lady finishes, with a meaning smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quesada extends his hand and presses slightly the
dainty palm laid therein. “Any of Don Manada’s friends
are welcome here,” he says. “I am happy to place the
quinta at your disposition, and its occupants are yours to
command, madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quesada leads the way into the house, whither Juanita
has retired to add a few touches to her toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are an American, Mrs. Harding,” ventures the
Don, as they pass through the long, wide corridor to
the gallery at the rear of the quinta and the lady is provided
with the easiest of chairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My accent told you that immediately,” is the smiling
response. “Yes; I am the widow of an American ship-owner,
who left to me, among other possessions, a sugar
plantation somewhere in this fair isle. I had the pleasure
of Don Manada’s acquaintance in New York, and
when he heard that I purposed visiting Cuba to view my
possessions, he desired that I seek you, giving me at
the same time the letter of introduction which, as I have
said, I have unfortunately left at my hotel in Santiago.
But perhaps the password which he whispered to me,
‘Cuba Libre,’ will do as well. For the cause of Cuban
liberty has no warmer sympathizer than myself, Don
Quesada,” she adds, earnestly, and the Don’s countenance
lights with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Manada could have conferred no greater pleasure,”
he replies, “and I trust that you will honor my
daughter and myself by becoming our guest, for a few
days at least.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel’s dark orbs snap with triumph not easily repressed,
but she answers hesitatingly: “Thank you, but
I do not see how I can trespass upon your kindness. I
have not the pleasure of an acquaintance with the senorita,
and—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Permit me to remove that objection at once,” interposes
Quesada, as Juanita at the moment stands in the
doorway. “Juanita, mi querida, this is Mrs. Isabel Harding,
an American lady and a friend of Don Manada,
whom you met in New York. I have invited her to
remain with us for a few days, or as long as our hospitality
may prove attractive. Will you not add your
request to mine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The more mature and voluptuous beauty of the older
woman attracts the impulsive Cuban girl, and she seconds
her father’s invitation with a sincerity that would
have won even a lady who had not come to the quinta
with the deliberate purpose of securing such a proffer of
hospitality.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the carriage is sent back to Santiago and
Isabel Harding is installed at the quinta, the surroundings
of which she finds much to her liking. Juanita is
much charmed with her American friend, who fascinates
the impressionable Cuban girl with her brilliant beauty,
her wit and her knowledge of the great world amid whose
pleasures and palaces Juanita lived for two years, and
which she hopes some day to see again. The two women
quickly become inseparable and naturally Juanita tells
Mrs. Harding of her other recent New York friend, Jack
Ashley. But Isabel, although she enjoys, or otherwise,
an acquaintance with that industrious young man, does
not know his name, and the adventuress has not even
the fear of his reappearance to disturb her present serenity.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the Don and his daughter are charmed by their
guest, not so Don Carlos, and it is with difficulty that
that gentle youth conceals his dislike. An instinctive distrust
of the beautiful American takes possession of him,
and to avoid exhibiting this distrust, which he admits to
himself is unfounded, he spends most of his time in solitary
walks about the vast pueblo or in long rides upon
the back of his favorite pony.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late in the afternoon of the 7th of April, two days
after the arrival of Mrs. Harding at the quinta, that lady,
her elderly host and his daughter are seated on the veranda,
enjoying the light breeze from the gulf which renders
life in Cuba endurable and even attractive for a
few hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>An interruption to the conversation comes in the person
of a courier, who rides up to the quinta, delivers to
Quesada a small packet of papers, and, after a glass of
wine, departs as hastily as he came.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Don excuses himself and retires to his study. A
few moments later he reappears and calls to Carlos, who
is coming up the lawn. Young Navarro bows to Mrs.
Harding and follows the Don into the study.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have just received important news,” says the latter.
“Capt. Guerra sends word that a big supply train was
dispatched by the captain-general from Havana for Santiago
this morning or last night. Is it not to-day or to-morrow
that Navarro was to be at or near Jibana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Carlos nods. “He should certainly be there now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quesada paces the room, his brow knitted in thought.
“If word could be got to him at once,” he says, “Dios!
The train might be captured. But how to send him
word—there is the obstacle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How far is Jibana from Santiago?” asks Carlos, into
whose mind has come a sudden thought that causes his
cheeks to alternately flush and pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A full day’s journey by rail. No; I fear word could
not be sent him in time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if a courier were to leave on the early morning
train, could he not reach Jibana in season to find Emilio?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps. It will take several days for the supply
train to make the trip, but it will also take us too long
to find a trustworthy messenger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you not consider me trustworthy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You!” cries Quesada, looking at the slender youth in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Don Manuel; I will be the courier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no; I cannot permit it. What would Emilio
say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will be too overjoyed to see me to think of scolding
you. There is no danger. Simply the discomfort
of the journey. I will start in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Against his better judgment, Quesada consents, and
as Carlos throws open the study door the vision of Mrs.
Harding flits by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the teacups half an hour later Isabel tells Don
Quesada that, if there is a conveyance to be easily procured
at Santos, she believes she will run into Santiago
for a day’s shopping. And Quesada informs her smilingly
that if she cares to arise with the sun she may find
a conveyance in waiting, as Carlos is going to the city
on business and will undoubtedly be charmed with her
society on the short journey.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>At Havana on the morning of the 8th of April.</p>

<p class='c011'>With contracted brows and frowning face, the captain-general
of Cuba scans a mass of official documents that
lie upon his desk. Gen. Truenos is plainly displeased
with the condition of affairs on the island. When he
sailed from Cadiz it was to “put down the rebellion in
three months,” as the Spanish press boastfully asserted,
but Truenos realizes that it is not now a matter of weeks
or months, but of years, ere the red and yellow of Spain
will wave again unchallenged over the gem of the Antilles.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime, Gen. Truenos gathers from the papers
before him that some of the matured plans of the
Spanish have been checkmated through treachery in
some quarter, and he is not enchanted with the glimpses
he has obtained of the manner in which his subordinates
conduct a campaign.</p>

<p class='c011'>An officer enters the room with a dispatch and the
captain-general reaches impatiently for the missive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Caspita!” he growls, as he glances over the contents.
“Murillo at least is alive to what is transpiring under the
very noses of my generals. I wish that I had more like
him.” Then to the officer: “Send Gen. Velasquez to
me at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the latter answers the summons, Truenos hands
him the dispatch, with the query: “Has the supply train
left for Santiago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It left last night, your excellency.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be stopped. As you will see by Murillo’s dispatch,
the rebels have learned of the train’s departure
and a courier is now en route from Santiago to notify
that infernal El Terredo. If that courier is not intercepted,
the supply train must be recalled or held. The
dispatch contains a description of the rebel messenger.
Now, then, to action.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Truenos unfolds a large map of the island, and as he
runs his finger along the line which indicates the railroad,
another dispatch is handed in. The captain-general
tears it open and reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reported that El Terredo is encamped near Jibana, with
a large force of insurgents.</p>
<div class='c017'>Alvarez.”</div>

<p class='c016'>“Ah,” remarks Truenos. “This is dated Cadoza. And
Cadoza,” he consults the map, “is less than a dozen miles
from Jibana. Bueno! For once matters are dovetailing
to my wishes. The courier cannot reach Jibana
before nightfall, and when he does Alvarez shall arrest
him. Let the supply train proceed, Velasquez, and immediately
wire Alvarez to arrest the rebel messenger at
or below Jibana. Send the description of the young man
given in Murillo’s dispatch and have Alvarez wire back
that he understands. Quick! There is no time to be
wasted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be an exciting night at Jibana.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c003' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE MEETING AT CADOZA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It is something like ten miles to Cadoza, another and
smaller railway town, and Ashley arrives about noon.
There is no American hotel here. Instead, a lazy Cuban
keeps a shiftless hostelry to which only necessity would
drive a man. A party of soldiers are gathered at the
inn and the yard is filled with their horses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley tethers his horse at a spot which he can overlook,
as Rozinante is an animal that would tempt a man
even more upright than a soldier in time of war. As he
gives the bridle an extra hitch, a hand is dropped on his
shoulder and a familiar voice whispers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack Ashley, by all that’s holy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley turns and cries out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, Barker, old man! Where’d you get your uniform?”
surveying the detective’s distinctly military attire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hist!” cautions Barker, glancing over his shoulder.
“Buy a drink at the hotel and then ride up the road a
piece. I’ll join you there.” Saying which the detective
walks away and Ashley enters the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>The drinking-room is filled with Spanish caballeria,
who glance curiously at the American; after procuring
a glass of wine and a cigar, Ashley mounts and rides
leisurely up the road. A quarter of a mile from the
hotel he finds Barker waiting, and he remarks, with a
grin: “Barker, you’re a fashion plate. Where on earth
did you get those togs?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it! Will you be serious ten minutes,” growls
Barker. “Let me tell you that the commanding officer
of the gang at the hotel is Capt. Julio Alvarez, who is
none other than our old friend Ralph Felton.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So? And to trail him you turned trooper, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly. Through him I expect to find the other
Felton, his father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can tell you a quicker way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Push along to Jibana, ten miles east of here. I left
Cyrus Felton, Phillip Van Zandt and Louise Hathaway
there this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick! Tell me all you know,” demands the detective,
aroused by the information imparted to him by his
co-worker.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley supplies the needed details, and Barker asks:
“You are reasonably sure that Felton and Van Zandt will
remain in Santiago for a fortnight?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you can depend on that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then affairs are shaping themselves advantageously
for our purpose. Our command will go to Jibana this
evening, but I don’t want any collision there. See the
position of the game. Van Zandt, if he is Stanley, is
tracking the son through the father, and I am trailing
the father through the son, intending to bag both of them,
as I have an interesting bit of what may prove strong evidence
against Ralph Felton. But I can’t do anything
with them at Jibana, and if Van Zandt runs afoul of young
Felton to-day he is likely to kick over all my plans. Santiago
is the place to play the last hand in this interesting
game.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I get the idea,” remarks Ashley. “But what is this
new evidence against young Fenton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This: That I believe he is wearing about his neck
at the present time the locket that was removed from
Roger Hathaway’s watch-chain the night of the murder
and bank robbery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley whistles softly. “That’s interesting,” he says.
“But how did you learn this? And while you are explaining
kindly give an account of yourself from the time
you jumped New York.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective complies, and when the interesting tale
is completed, Ashley says earnestly: “Barker, old chap,
my confidence in you has been increased tenfold in the
last month.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” responds the detective, though he suspects
some raillery in the newspaper man’s remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. There was a time when I doubted you a bit.
And when you made arrangements to arrest Cyrus Felton
I about concluded that the case was to prove after
all an ordinary affair. But you have redeemed yourself,
Barker. You have proved that the detective I have
long admired in the pages of fiction is not a myth, but
has his prototype in real life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed?” grunts Barker. “Go on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; just before you descended upon your victim
with a triumphant swoop, said victim gave you the slip.
Undaunted by such a trifling discouragement, you
struck a bee line for Havana, and there—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, stow your chaff. I’d like to know whose tomfoolery
prevented Felton’s arrest in New York. By
thunder, if I could have got your ear a moment after I
discovered Felton’s departure for Cuba, I’d have given
you a dressing-down that would have knocked some of
the self-sufficiency out of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you can consider yourself forgiven,” says Ashley,
soothingly. “What’s up at Jibana? Anything special?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; a rather important bit of work. This morning
Capt. Alvarez, to give him the name he chooses to sail
under, learned that a large force of insurgents under El
Terredo were encamped somewhere between Cadoza and
Jibana. He wired the fact to Havana and not ten minutes
later received instructions to intercept a courier for
the rebels who was on his way from Santiago to Jibana,
presumably with dispatches to El Terredo. Although only
his orderly, I am pretty close to Alvarez. The chap has
taken quite a fancy to me, and to give him his due he is
a devilishly clever fellow, with more pluck and fighting
blood in him than a dozen Spaniards. American blood
will tell, my boy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what’s the plan for the night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This: We are to flag the train about a mile below
Jibana and do the trick quietly, as the feeling about here
is pretty strong against the Spanish; arrest the courier,
secure the papers, and wire Havana that the road is
clear, as I understand the dispatches relate to the big
supply train which is on its way from the capital
to Santiago. Truenos, you know, is shifting his headquarters
to the latter city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the supply train has already left Havana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Presumably. The rebels at the Santiago end of the
line got wind of the shipment, and have sent Don Carlos
to put El Terredo onto the fact.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Carlos!” repeats Ashley, with a start that Barker
does not notice; “and what disposition will you make
of the prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker shrugs his shoulders. “He will probably be
honorably shot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unhappy youth!” murmurs Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is rather tough,” remarks Barker, coolly. “But it
is the fortune of war.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s forehead is wrinkled in thought. “I’d like to
take a hand in the fun to-night,” he remarks carelessly.
“I’ve been journeying through the desert for more than
three days, with not a sign of adventure. I don’t suppose
it would do for me to show myself to Alvarez. How
many men has he with him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Twenty, including himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does he intend to take the entire command with him
to hold up the train?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; the affair is to be transacted in the quietest manner.
Alvarez, myself and four more men are to leave
the hotel about 9 o’clock—the train is due at Jibana at
10—and proceed down the track a mile or so. A few
swings of the lantern and the train will stop, Don Carlos
be removed and the train signaled to go ahead. If the
arrest were made publicly, word might get to El Terredo,
and the government’s plans for a safe passage of
the supply train would be frustrated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your business completed at Jibana, I suppose you
will push directly on to Santiago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and you?” queries Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall probably follow at a respectful distance. I
have been stopping at the Hotel Royal in Santiago, and
you will probably find me there if I am in the city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is Felton looking?” asks the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Badly; I shouldn’t wonder if he had a presentiment
that some sort of disaster was impending.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Miss Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Superb as ever. There is apparently a tender regard
existing between her and Van Zandt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Strange, strange are the workings of fate,” philosophizes
Barker, and with a sly grin he adds: “How are
your studies in statuary progressing, Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suspended for the present, most sympathetic Barker.
Just now I am interested in a study of the life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah; some dark-eyed Cuban senorita?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The most beautiful woman in the world,” is Ashley’s
enthusiastic tribute.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker laughs good-humoredly, then suddenly exclaims:
“Hello! There’s the trumpet call. I must be
off. By the way, I’ve changed my name to Parker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Parker! Why don’t you get a name to match your
clothes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go to thunder!” retorts the detective. “So long. I’ll
see you at Santiago.” Barker plunges into the woods beside
the road and returns to the hotel by a circuitous
route.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll see me again before you reach Santiago,” soliloquizes
Ashley, gazing after his friend’s retreating form.
“If Navarro is in these mountains I’ll search him out,
and we’ll have a hand in the game at Jibana to-night
that will remind Capt. Alvarez of a certain little straight
flush he ran up against once upon a time. And if Navarro
is not to be found, then, by George, I’ll play the
hand alone!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>“EL TERREDO.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Ashley waits until he believes that Capt. Alvarez and
his men have got fairly on their way toward Jibana;
then he mounts Rozinante and rides back to the hotel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half a mile to the eastward, the landlord tells him,
a trail leads off into the mountains. Ashley remembers
passing it in the morning. Fortifying himself with a
dinner, he sets forth.</p>

<p class='c011'>After he strikes the mountain path, his progress is
slow and painful. It is a dreary road, steep and treacherous.
About him nothing but rocks, red clay, cactus
and bog and a stunted growth of trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley left the hotel in the vicinity of 1 o’clock, and
by 3 he has hardly covered four miles. “If I do not
secure reinforcements within the hour I must ’bout face
and ride to Jibana,” he reflects. “A man could never
find his way out of this howling wilderness after nightfall!
Jove! It must have been a matter of urgent importance
that necessitated the dispatching of Don Carlos
to Jibana. Poor little chap!” he mutters, and as
he thinks of young Navarro lying under the stars with
a bullet through his heart, he urges Rozinante at a dangerous
pace.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another half-hour goes by. Ashley is now in the
mountains, and yet no living being has he seen to break
the depressive solitude. Suddenly there rings out the
command:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alto, ahi!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley checks his horse, looks about him and discovers
that he is the center of a circle of leveled muskets,
the owners of which are hidden from view.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, gentlemen, I’m out,” announces Jack, cheerfully,
as he removes his eye-glasses and wipes the dust
and moisture from them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Forth from the bushes steps a gaunt Cuban, in a tattered
uniform and with feet that have long since parted
association with shoes. Throwing his musket across
his arm, he hurls an inquiry at Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ve got me there,” states the correspondent, and
smiling around the ominous fringe of musket barrels.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally, giving up all idea of a conversation with the
dark-featured mountaineers, “El Terredo!” he cries, “El
Terredo! Endonde El Terredo? I don’t know whether
that’s right or not, but it’s the best I have in stock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The mountaineer appears to grasp the idea. He
shouts something to the men in the bushes, and a dozen
lusty fellows, white and black, come forth. The leader
makes a sign to Ashley to go ahead, and the latter obeys.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a mile or more the little cavalcade proceeds, when
suddenly the leader of Ashley’s silent escort emits a shrill
whistle. An answering signal is faintly heard, and then
the march is resumed. Five minutes later Jack rides
into a clearing and hears a welcome voice ring out:
“Welcome, Senor Ashley!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glad to see you, Navarro,” says Ashley, heartily, as
he drops from his horse and grips the insurgent leader’s
hand. “Is this part of your army?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; hardy fellows, every man of them,” replies Navarro,
signalling his followers to fall back. “What on
earth brings you into the mountains?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thought I’d drop round and return thanks for your
generous gift.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, say nothing of that. I should have been glad
to have sent you a stable of horses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One was enough. But this is incidental. You expect
dispatches from Santiago to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; that is, no special ones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some are on their way, nevertheless, in the keeping of
Don Carlos.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Carlos!” cries Navarro, turning pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay; but that is not all. The errand of Don Carlos
has become known at Havana and orders have been
wired to Capt. Alvarez, who is now on his way from
Cadoza to Jibana, if he is not already there, to intercept
the courier, and secure the dispatches.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro staggers as if dealt a blow. “My God! They
will shoot him like a dog!” he groans, his face white as
death. “When—where is Carlos to arrive?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At Jibana, at 10 to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho! Then all is not lost,” flashes Navarro. “By
heaven! I’ll wipe Jibana and every Spaniard in it from
the face of the earth!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Easy, my friend,” counsels Ashley, grasping the infuriated
man by the arm. “If Don Carlos is to be saved,
and also the dispatches—keep those in mind—you will
need your wits more than a thousand men. Now, listen
to me a moment. There is time enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yesterday, or the day before, or sometime within the
week, a big supply train left Havana for Santiago. Information
of its dispatch must have been received by Don
Quesada, and, knowing your whereabouts—did he know
them?”—Navarro nods—“he has sent Don Carlos to
notify you, that the train may be captured. This morning
Capt. Alvarez was at Cadoza. He heard it rumored
that a large force of insurgents were encamped in these
mountains. He wired Havana to that effect, and ten
minutes later received orders to intercept Don Carlos.
I learned this while at Cadoza, and realizing the danger
that threatened your brother, I set off for the mountains,
trusting to Providence to run across you or some of your
men. On my way hither I devised a plan by which you
can outwit Alvarez and later capture the ammunition
train—and I do not believe in doing things by halves.
But first, how far is it to Jibana?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About six miles, as the crow flies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That means eight or ten by these awful bridal-paths,
then. You have a score of men here at least. They will
be more than enough. Now, I will outline my plan and
we can perfect it on our way to Jibana.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro listens without interruption while Ashley
talks. When the programme for the night has been
sketched, Navarro’s dark eyes moisten and he seizes
Jack’s hands in a grip that makes the latter wince. “Ashley,
you’re a hero!” he cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense,” laughs Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can never repay the debt of gratitude I owe you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t try. Suppose we push along to Jibana. We
can talk matters over on the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. We will start at once,” says Navarro, and
he communicates an order to his men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many men have you back in the mountains?”
Ashley inquires of Navarro as they ride side by side
through the desert of rock and chaparral.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two thousand. Accessions have been coming every
day. But they are not directly under my command.
My part in the revolution has been a rather peculiar one.
Up to a fortnight or so ago, when I parted with you on
the Santos road, my identity was as much a mystery
as that of the president of the provisional republic. Unsuspected
as a leading factor in the struggle for independence,
I mingled with the Spanish and listened with
a smile to the stories told of the prowess of the cruiser
Pearl of the Antilles and her mysterious commander, El
Terredo. At the time the Mercedes was sunk I did
command the Pearl and with my own hand aimed the
dynamite gun that sent the Spanish battleship to the
bottom. But most of my time has been spent on land.
I have done more planning than fighting, and while I
rejoice not in a single title except that of El Terredo,
in a land where titles are cheap, my authority is unlimited,
my orders are implicitly obeyed, and I could ruin
Cuba Libre with a single command.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you not fearful of being recognized during some
of your trips into the camp of the enemy?” asked Ashley,
looking at the young man with undisguised admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro smiles. “There will be no further exposure.
When I left the quinta with you it was to take the field,
not to leave it until Santiago falls. After the capture of
the ammunition train, if luck favors us, I leave here for
the coast,” pointing westward. “In a harbor yonder
rides the Pearl of the Antilles, and when I take command
of her it will be the opening of a campaign that Spain’s
navy will long remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Until Santiago falls?” repeats Ashley. “You look
for the capitulation of that city?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Within a fortnight Gen. Masso will hurl 10,000 men
upon it. The troops back in these mountains will form
part of an army against which 20,000 Spanish will not
avail. Unless you insist upon reporting the siege for
your paper amid the bursting of shells and the roar of
artillery, keep away from Santiago—at Santos, for instance.
The Spanish squadron is already on its way to
Santiago, and when the city falls into the hands of the
patriots the battleships will open fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I believe I will return to Santiago at once—or
after our night’s work is finished. Shall we reach the
edge of Jibana before nightfall?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Probably not, but in season for the work in hand. It
will be a night that Capt. Alvarez will long remember
if memory lasts beyond this world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove! That will never do,” exclaims Ashley.
Navarro looks at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alvarez must not be injured,” declares Jack. “I have
particular reasons for keeping Alvarez alive for some
time to come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather awkward,” laughs Navarro. “I don’t see but
that you will have to overlook the job to-night, and sort
out your friend, for I expect it will be necessary to kill
one or two of the gang.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley reflects a moment. “You should be able to
identify the leader,” he says, and he adds to himself: “As
for Barker, I shall have to prevent his taking part in the
affair. It’s a ticklish job all round.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, your wishes shall be respected,” says Navarro.
“Capt. Alvarez shall live. He is fortunate in having so
influential a friend at court.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some of the most worthless of men are more valuable
alive than dead. I have no friendship for Alvarez, but
his demise just at present would complicate certain matters
in which I have a large interest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The moon is creeping up over a crest of the range,
when, at a signal from the guide, Navarro calls a halt.
After a whispered consultation, he tells Ashley that they
are some little distance below the Jibana hotel and railway
station.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two hundred rods beyond us lies the road,” he says;
“and fifty yards farther is the track. We will hitch here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” declares Ashley. “Here, then, we separate.
It is now nearly 8 o’clock,” consulting his watch
by the glow of his cigar. “Good luck, old man. The
signal for my reappearance will be the old rallying cry
of ‘Santiago.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The men exchanged a hearty handclasp. Then Ashley
dismounts, and headed by the guide, leads Rozinante
through the brush to the road. Here he vaults into the
saddle again and canters toward the town.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE FIGHT IN THE MOONLIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Didn’t expect you back so soon,” declares Landlord
Carter, answering Ashley’s halloa without the Hotel
Americano at Jibana.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am a little ahead on my own calculations,” is the reply.
“Are the Americans still here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; left this afternoon for Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Full house, though, I judge,” motioning toward the
windows of the reading-room, from which emanate
snatches of song and the clink of glasses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; gang of Spanish troopers. Noisy devils. Stop
overnight, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sure. I want some supper in a hurry and a room at
your leisure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The landlord shouts to the hostler, who leads Rozinante
away to his well-earned grain, and Ashley follows
Carter into the hotel, with the remark: “I do not care
to have those chaps in there see me, or know who I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, sir. This way. The troopers are all in
the drinking-room and they haven’t moved out of their
chairs for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Supper over, Ashley is shown to his room and the
landlord is about to make his exit with a cheerful “good-night,”
when Ashley remarks:</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, have you an old coat and hat of any
description?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Carter scratches his head reflectively. “I have an old
Grand Army uniform that I brought with me from the
states. I was a member of the 13th Massachusetts volunteers,
and after the war joined the Chelsea post,
when—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will do very nicely,” interrupts Ashley. “I want
to borrow the uniform for a few hours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, sir. I’ll get it out in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I want it to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good, sir. I’ve been too long in this business
to ask questions. Used to run a small hotel in Boston,”
grins Carter, as he vanishes. He returns shortly with the
clothes, and Ashley, after a glance, pronounces them satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One more request, Carter. You noticed, perhaps,
among your guests a rather short, thick-set party, with
a dark, closely cropped mustache.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Smokes a short, black pipe and looks like an Englishman?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the chap. Send him up, but don’t attract the
attention of his companions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Carter nods and disappears, and a few minutes later
the good-natured countenance of John Barker is thrust
into the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buenas tardes, Senor Parker,” is Ashley’s salutation.
“Come in and shut the door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where the devil did you come from?” demands the
detective, dropping into a chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Up the road a piece. I got tired of journeying
through the desert, and concluded to take the back
track. Fill up your pipe and make yourself sociable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t stop. It is nearly 9 o’clock and we start at that
hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes; on the business you were telling me of this
noon. You haven’t changed your plans, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; there was no occasion to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it is not absolutely essential that you should
accompany Alvarez, is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was his wish. With the exception of Alvarez
and myself and the four men who were to supplement our
little party, the command knows nothing definite of the
evening’s work. Alvarez doesn’t fraternize much with
his followers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not send a man in your stead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid it is too late to make any changes in the
plans. Most of the men below are half-shot now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley takes a turn about the room and drops his hand
on his friend’s shoulder. “Barker,” he says, “it was
only this noon that you requested me to be serious for
at least ten minutes on a stretch. I never was more
serious than I am now, when I say to you, don’t accompany
Alvarez on his errand to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the deuce are you so interested in the affair for
all at once?” queries the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, remain here, and I will enlighten you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment the impatient shout, “Ho, Parker!”
floats up from the hotel yard, and with the remark, “I’m
off; see you later, Jack,” Barker bounds from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hang it! I ought to have told him at the outset
how the land lay,” mutters Ashley. “Now, I suppose I
shall have to direct my undivided efforts to preventing
his slaughter at the hands of Navarro’s men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley slips off his coat and gets into the faded uniform
of the landlord, dons the Grand Army hat and pulls it
down over his eyes; examines his revolvers to make certain
that they are in proper working order, and then,
blowing out his lamp, seats himself by the open window,
where he can command a view of the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shortly after 9 o’clock he sees six forms cross the
band of moonlight into the shadows beyond. He waits
ten minutes and then glides softly down the stairway and
out into the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez and his men leave the hotel afoot and instead
of taking the railroad track, proceed down the highway.
Alvarez rode over the ground during the afternoon and
selected a point about a mile and a half below the village
as the place for holding up the train. Here the road
crosses the railway and beyond is a long stretch of
straight track.</p>

<p class='c011'>The six proceed silently to the appointed spot, and
then, there being no further occasion for secrecy, they
fall to smoking and chatting. The train is due at Jibana
at 10 and there is yet half an hour to wait.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty minutes of it go by, when Alvarez discovers
that his party is short two men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho! Sancho! Francisco!” he calls, and repeats the
shout, there being no response. “Whither went they,
Parker?” he asks, turning to his orderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were here a few minutes ago, captain. I last
noticed them strolling toward the road.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez utters an impatient growl. “Search them
out, Pedro, and thou, too, Juan. The train will be here
in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the two troopers addressed take themselves off in
quest of their companions Alvarez lights a lantern and
hands it to the orderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, what disposition is to be made of the
prisoner?” asks the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall have to shoot him, I expect,” is the cool response.
“We can’t very well take him with us, and we
certainly cannot turn him loose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems a rather cold-blooded piece of business. It
savors of murder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the word Alvarez shivers slightly. The nights in
Cuba are damp and chilly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ten o’clock,” he mutters, holding his watch to the
lantern. “Where the devil are my men? We shall likely
have to go in search of the second pair. Ha, the train!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The whistle of the Havana express is heard in the distance
and the men leap to their feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Down the track with you,” orders Alvarez. “As for
you,” turning to four forms that are approaching from
the shadows of the highway, “el diablo! What sort of
men have I in my command?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The troopers make no reply to the angry query of
their leader.</p>

<p class='c011'>The orderly swings his lantern and an answering blast
comes from the train, which draws up upon the crossing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have an order for the arrest of one of your passengers,”
Alvarez informs the conductor. “Watch the train
and see that no one leaves it,” he tells the four troopers,
and, followed by the orderly, he boards the first coach.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within this is the object of their search. Don Carlos
Navarro is reclining wearily in a seat about midway
of the car. He starts when the soldiers enter and the
color flows from his cheeks when they stop before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez consults a paper, and, glancing from it to
young Navarro, remarks: “The very chap. I have a
warrant for your arrest, sir.” Then to the orderly:
“Remove the prisoner, Parker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By thunder, he’s fainted,” mutters the orderly, as
he bears the limp form from the car.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Search him,” commands Alvarez, signaling to the
conductor to go ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the train rumbles away the orderly goes through
the coat pockets of the prisoner, but without finding any
sign of papers, rebel dispatches or otherwise. Then he
tears open the unconscious youth’s shirt, and the next
instant utters an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By heaven! It’s a woman!” he mutters, as he deposits
his burden tenderly on the ground and straightens up to
acquaint his chief of the surprising bit of intelligence.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>The moon swings high above the range when Ashley
leaves the hotel and proceeds down the railroad track,
the route he naturally supposes Alvarez and his party
have taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the newspaper man, revolver in hand, moves slowly
and cautiously along, his eyes on the alert for a glimpse
of Alvarez’ party, the danger of his situation suddenly
occurs to him. If the Spaniards have already stationed
themselves at some point along the rail he is likely to
stumble upon them at any minute.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last he sights the party of troopers. Then he
remembers that the road is close by, and stealing through
the brush, he proceeds softly along the highway until
the hum of conversation greets his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>He crawls at a safe distance to a position beyond the
group, not twenty feet distant from the spot where Alvarez
and Barker are seated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brush is dense and he has nothing now to do
but keep perfectly still. He has seen or heard nothing
of El Torredo or his men, but he knows that secreted
somewhere in the waste of chaparral around him are
stout hearts and strong arms waiting for the cry of “Santiago!”
to rouse them to swift action.</p>

<p class='c011'>He watches Alvarez light the lantern, and, as the rays
fall upon the orderly’s features Ashley thinks: “If I
could only get within whispering distance of the old man
I’d give him a quiet tip to make himself exceeding
scarce.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But at this instant the whistle of the express is heard
and Ashley raises himself on his elbows. He sees Barker
start down the track, and his impulse is to follow. But
to do so he will have to cross a broad belt of moonlit
open, and at this moment the four troopers come up.</p>

<p class='c011'>The train comes to a standstill, Don Carlos is removed,
the cars rumble away, and Ashley notes with satisfaction
that the search for the papers is being conducted by
the orderly. “He will not be harmed should Navarro’s
men open fire, if he keeps close to Carlos,” he thinks.</p>

<p class='c011'>But where is Navarro? The situation is becoming
strained for the young man in the Grand Army uniform.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack is watching Barker. He hears him utter an ejaculation
of astonishment as he lays the unconscious form
of Carlos upon the ground. And then he hears a hoarse
bellow of rage and sees one of Alvarez’ troopers whip
out his sword and spring upon the orderly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Less than a dozen feet separate Ashley and Barker.
With a cry of warning, Jack dashes forward and catches
the descending arm just in time to avert the certain
destruction of the detective, who is wholly off his guard.
As it is, the edge of the falling blade catches Barker
across the forehead, half-stunning him and cutting a
gash that means a scar to recall this night in years to
come. At the same instant Ashley recognizes El Terredo
in the wielder of the sword, and he whispers, “Easy,
Navarro,” in time to check a slash at his own head.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile the remaining three troopers have hurled
themselves upon Alvarez and Barker. It all occurs in
a flash and before Ashley recovers from his surprise
at the unexpected turn of events a shrill whistle from
Navarro has summoned nearly a score more of men
from the surrounding shadows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro raises Don Carlos in his arms and the youth,
who has recovered consciousness, clasps his arms about
his brother’s neck and bursts into tears of joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, be a man,” soothes the latter. “Remain here
a few minutes while I look after your Spanish friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro picks up the lantern and flashes its rays into
Alvarez’ face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s this?” he cries. “By heaven, Captain Alvarez,
I think we have met before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the two men confront each other in the moonlight,
there is no need of the lantern for each to see the other’s
countenance.</p>

<p class='c011'>An exclamation of surprise and rage escapes Alvarez’
lips, and he struggles in the grasp of the two men who
pinion his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curse you!” he grits, in a voice choked with passion;
“I’d give half my life for five minutes of fair play now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fair play?” sneers Navarro. “You do not know the
meaning of the phrase. You are a thief, a blackguard,
and a traitor!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez wrenches free by a mighty effort and with a
fearful oath hurls himself upon Navarro.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE METAMORPHOSIS OF DON CARLOS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Stand back!” commands Navarro, as his men start
forward to the enraged Alvarez, whose fingers have
twined about the insurgent leader’s neck. “Back, I say!
I can handle this gentleman without assistance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Alvarez is as a child in the steely arms of El Terredo.
The latter tears the clutching fingers from his throat,
sweeps the Spanish captain off his feet and dashes him
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half-stunned and crazed by passion, Alvarez struggles
to his knees and whips out a pistol. It is knocked from
his grasp before his arm straightens, as half a dozen
watchful Cubans pounce upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Away with them!” orders Navarro, with a sweep of
his arm, and as Alvarez and Barker are hustled off in
the darkness he turns to Don Carlos, who has been a
silent and trembling witness of the conflict.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In heaven’s name, my brother, what brings you on
this errand? Don Manuel must be mad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Emilio, do not blame Don Manuel,” gently protests
Carlos, as he embraces Navarro. “The matter was
urgent, a courier was required, and I myself suggested
that I be that courier. To see you again I would have
dared the perils of the journey, even were nothing more
at stake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brave heart,” murmurs Navarro, brushing back the
ringlets from his brother’s brow. “But let this be your
last commission, Carlos. I would not jeopardize your
life for a thousand Cubas. But come, is the news you
bring me verbal or written?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For answer Carlos places a letter in Navarro’s hands,
and the latter reads it by the light of the lantern. It
is brief, and as he thrusts it into his pocket Jack steps
forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Ashley,” cries Navarro, grasping him by the hand;
“the trick was quickly done, eh? Carlos, it is to our
American friend that you owe your present safety and
perhaps your life. It was he who warned me of the plot
for your arrest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spare me any praise,” protests Ashley, as Carlos is
about to express his gratitude. “By good fortune I
became acquainted with Alvarez’ design, and further luck
cast me in your brother’s way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“After you rode for miles into the mountains in search
of me,” interposes Navarro.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” laughs Jack, “for I had a suspicion that, single-handed,
I should not have been a match for the Spanish
captain and his men. Now, will you tell me, my
friend, how you circumvented Alvarez so cleverly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was an accident. The Spaniards came down the
road instead of the railroad track. When they located
themselves at the crossing we established our party about
200 yards from them, to wait the coming of the train.
The watch growing irksome, I and two of my men set
forth to reconnoiter. We had scarcely proceeded fifty
yards, when we stood face to face in the moonlight with
two of the troopers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Instantly we threw ourselves upon them and stifled
their attempts to sound an alarm. They were dragged
back to our ambush, bound hand and foot, and pistols
placed to their heads with orders that they be instantly
shot at the first outcry. I rightly assumed that their
companions would institute search for them, and shortly
after two more troopers came up the road. These we
took from the rear and when all four were safely secured
the idea of exchanging our dress for theirs and rejoining
Alvarez naturally suggested itself. The rest you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and I also know that only by a fraction of a
second did I prevent your glittering sword blade from
carving in twain the head of a very warm friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How? The fellow who was holding Carlos?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The same. He is an American, like myself, but it
suits his purpose for the present to masquerade as a
soldier of Castile. At the moment I interfered you were
about to slaughter the man to whom Carlos primarily
owes his escape to-night, for it was through him that I
learned of the plan to arrest the messenger to El Terredo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“San Pedro!” cries the impetuous Navarro, in tones
of sincere regret. “I should never have forgiven myself.
But I will at once set him at liberty and add the poor
consolation of an honest apology.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is exactly what I do not wish you to do. It
was to avoid recognition that I rigged out in this uniform,
and I am confident that Alvarez did not recognize me.
Barker, that is my friend’s name, may or may not have
discovered my identity when I cried out to you at the
moment I clutched your arm. At any rate, I shall not
attempt to ascertain. The principal point I wish to
insist upon, if you will permit me, is that Alvarez and
Barker shall not be separated; further, that they be permitted
to proceed to Santiago within forty-eight hours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your wishes shall be respected, my dear Ashley,”
says Navarro.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where have you had the prisoners taken?” asks Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the ambush I spoke of, about 200 yards up the
road.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your further plans?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I intended to have marched the Spaniards back to
the mountains as prisoners of war. Within the hour I
shall send a courier to the revolutionary camp with orders
to forward two hundred men with which to capture the
supply train. They should arrive early to-morrow forenoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. That work successfully accomplished, you can
then permit Alvarez and Barker to depart in peace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you so desire. And now suppose we rejoin my
men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the two move away Ashley’s eye is caught by the
glitter of a small object upon the ground. He picks
it up and discovers that it is a locket attached to a broken
bit of chain. As he turns it over in his hands and seeks
to examine it in the pale light of the moon, Navarro calls
to him from the road: “Still surveying the battlefield,
Ashley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Coming,” says Jack. He drops his find into his hip
pocket and proceeds to forget all about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is to be done with Carlos, now that he is here?”
he inquires as he rejoins the Navarros.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Carlos must return to Santiago at once,” declares El
Terredo. “If I might add to the already large debt of
gratitude, I would ask that you accompany him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gladly, Navarro. My intentions were to make Santiago
at all speed. You will not have Carlos return by
rail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; by horse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a possibility of running into trouble upon
his arrival at the city.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True; and to obviate that I have conceived a plan,
not startlingly original. Carlos must disguise himself
in feminine attire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, then I pose in the role of a knight errant escorting
a beautiful maiden over the desert sands to her ancestral
halls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro laughs softly. “Is the part distasteful to you?”
he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay. My only regret will be that Carlos is not the
beauteous maid she will represent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he will look the part to perfection, I promise you.
Half a dozen of my men will act as escort and conduct
Carlos to the quinta. But I want the assurance of your
active head and arm the greater part of the journey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. And the female toggery—where is that
to be procured?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is a more difficult matter to adjust. Do you
think the same wardrobe that fitted you out to-night
could be called upon in this emergency?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is possible,” replies Ashley. “There are women
folks about the Hotel Americana, else the house would
not present its unusually neat appearance. And there
being women some of them probably have a dress or
two to spare. I will endeavor to negotiate with the landlord
for a suitable costume for your brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excellent. I will await you here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The village is quiet as a churchyard when Ashley
reaches the hotel. Lights are visible, however, and a
few raps upon the portals bring forth the landlord.</p>

<p class='c011'>Carter receives back his Grand Army habiliments
without comment, but his face is a study when Ashley
broaches the idea of a feminine rig.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By gum,” he exclaims; “you’re the funniest customer
I’ve run up against in all my Cuban hotel business, and
I have met some queer ones, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Carter,” confides Ashley, “as a matter of
fact, I am not altogether right in my head. I am seized
at frequent periods with the most absurd notions. Fortunately,
I always have money enough to gratify my
freakish ideas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not so soft as I look,” remarks Carter, dryly.
“I’ll see what I can do for you. How soon do you want
the clothes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As usual, at once. And while they are being hunted
up I wish you would have my horse saddled, as I must
take the road within the hour. It is getting along toward
midnight. Where are the troopers—drunk or asleep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Both, most of them,” is the laconic response, as the
boniface takes himself off to consult with his wife upon
the subject of providing a costume for a slender young
man about five feet in height, as Ashley describes the
prospective wearer of the garments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Landlord Carter has a daughter who rejoices in the
possession of three dresses. This alone should constitute
her the belle of Jibana. For a sum sufficient to
double her wardrobe the young lady is induced to part
with the best of her three outfits and a bargain is consummated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Carter is not at all pleased at being routed from
her slumbers, but she is a rather pretty young woman,
and after five minutes of Ashley’s persuasive eloquence
the landlord’s daughter beams with good nature and
laughingly inquires: “Do you want a complete costume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the last ribbon,” declares Jack. “By Jove!” he
adds, mentally, “if Carlos proposes to impersonate a
young lady, he shall not lack verisimilitude through any
neglect on my part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A thousand thanks, Miss Carter,” says Ashley, when
the clothes are finally tied in a big bundle and given into
his possession.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t this too much?” demurs the young lady, glancing
at the gold coin which he places in her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit,” replies Jack. “If it is”—he glances around,
sees that papa Carter has disappeared, and snatches a kiss
from the young lady’s red lips—“if it is, will you permit
me to balance the debt?” he finishes. Miss Carter
blushes furiously, but she does not reprove the audacity.
Good-looking young men, alas, are few in Jibana.</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour later Ashley turns the bundle of apparel
over to Navarro and receives the latter’s warmest thanks.
“At what time do we start?” Jack inquires.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At daybreak. You will need a few hours’ rest before
then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can use them all right. But suppose Alvarez’ men
come nosing around after their absent leader?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They will not find him. Follow me and I will lead
you to our camp for the night. I shall send with you
as a guide a man who knows the country well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the dawn the little party is under way. Ashley
stares in astonishment at the metamorphosis that has been
effected in the person of Carlos. And as Carlos raises
his veil and returns Jack’s stare with a glance in which
amusement is mingled with blushing diffidence, the newspaper
man laughs outright.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you he would look the part to perfection,”
remarks the elder Navarro, as he comes forward to say
adios. “Take good care of him, Ashley, mi amigo. He
is very dear to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For your sake I will guard him with jealous care,”
replies Ashley. “Good-by, Navarro. I hope to see you
again before many days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most heartily do I echo the wish. But who can say
what the future has in store?” murmurs the insurgent
leader. He watches the little cavalcade until it disappears
down the forest trail and then turns toward the mountains
with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley drops to the rear of the little procession, lights
a cigar and relapses into a reverie. Suddenly he bethinks
him of the locket which he picked up on the scene of
last night’s struggle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although his eyes never before rested upon it, as he
looks at it now the locket has almost a familiar appearance.
He is somewhat prepared for the surprise which
follows his pressing of the spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>The locket formerly contained two miniatures. One
has been removed. That which yet remains is an exquisite
portrait of Louise Hathaway.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley stares at the gold ornament with its broken
bit of chain he realizes that he is looking upon the locket
supposed to have been removed from the watch-chain
of Roger Hathaway the night the aged cashier came to
his death in the Raymond National Bank.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE DOVE AND THE SERPENT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Whoa, Rozinante! If thou art as weary of this road
as I, good beast, a rest will not go against thy grain,
or grass. What say you to a halt of half an hour within
the shade of this royal palm?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is the afternoon of the third day since Ashley’s
return to Santiago, and, having parted with Don Carlos
and the escorting party on the edge of Santos, this
is the first opportunity Jack has had to ride out to La
Quinta de Quesada and pay his respects to Don Manuel’s
beautiful daughter; for the last three days have been
busy ones for the newspaper man. Truenos has arrived
with his fleet from Havana, and the next week promises
to be big with the fate of Cuba Libre.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley left Santiago an hour ago, and at the rate he
has been traveling—the heat precludes a gait faster than
a moderate amble—he judges that he has covered three
of the four miles to Santos.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitching the amiable Rozinante, he throws himself
upon the turf beneath the foliage-massed branches of the
royal palm, and lights a cigar; as he smokes he grows
thoughtful. And from rumination he drifts into moralizing,
addressing himself to Rozinante.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here, Rozinante; if you have any horse sense
that you’re not using you might assist your master to
extricate himself from somewhat of a quandary. As you
know, I came to Cuba principally on business for my
paper, incidentally to trail down a murder mystery and
again incidentally to follow a fair face belonging to the
beautiful Louise Hathaway. A good many chaps in my
place would have fallen hopelessly in love with Miss
Hathaway at first sight, but I—well, that is not the cause
of my quandary. If it were, I could easily dismiss it
with a philosophical ‘there is no accounting for the tastes
of most women.’ Ah, no, Rozinante; it is something
far more serious; for what I want to ask you, Rozinante,
is whether you believe that I, in my old age, have been
so indiscreet as to fall in love?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Rozinante, being a well-bred equine, declines to
poke his nose into young people’s affairs and continues
his grass-cropping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See how the case stands, Rozinante,” continues Jack,
tossing a pebble at his four-footed companion to enforce
attention. “On the one hand is the Senorita Juanita de
Quesada, the acknowledged Pearl of the Antilles, the
adored of all the beaux in Santiago; Juanita, the beautiful,
the accomplished, and the only child of the wealthy
and elderly Don Manuel de Quesada, who is likely to
become the president de facto of this cheerful country if
the yellow fever continues to wilt the imported flower of
the chivalry of Spain. On the other hand, Rozinante,
look at me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment Rozinante lifts his head and blinks
comically at Ashley, who grins back in the best of
humors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I know what you are thinking about, Rozinante.
You are saying to yourself: ‘What a presumptuous fellow!
But he is just like all Americans.’ Well, you are
not far from right, Rozzy. We Americans are a bit
fresh. But that is a digression. To return to our subject,
which is the always agreeable one of myself. Now,
I am not a bad-looking chap. You can see that, Roz,
with one eye. And I am fairly bright and all that. But
hang it! I haven’t a bank account bigger than three
figures, and it will require nerve, my grass-eating friend,
to step up to the wealthy Don Quesada and say: ‘Don,
old boy, I love your daughter. May I ask your blessing?’
No one ever accused me of lacking in nerve, but have I
enough to supply the demand of such an occasion? Of
course, if Don Quesada becomes president of the republic
of Cuba, and makes me his cabinet-premier, I might
buy a sugar plantation and become enormously wealthy.
But that, Rozinante, as you are probably aware, is a
twenty-to-one shot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The most perplexing feature of the whole affair is
the fact that I have no good reason to suppose that the
dark-eyed Juanita returns in the slightest degree the deep
interest which I feel in her personal welfare. I know that
she likes me—why shouldn’t she?—but her maidenly
reserve I do not seem to be able to successfully penetrate.
Again, my equine friend, I am not so certain that she is
not hopelessly in love with that effeminate, downy-cheeked,
pink-and-white and milk-and-water Don Carlos.
And how any woman can—But, pshaw! What is
the use in quarreling with the chap? And what is the
use of my lounging longer here, talking at an unappreciative
audience? Ah, Juanita, if you would but encourage
me a bit I would soon solve my perplexity. Just a
draught from this spring back in the bushes, Rozinante,
and then we will jog along toward Santos.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley bends over the spring the grating of carriage
wheels sounds in the road.</p>

<p class='c011'>A volante flashes by at what seems reckless speed;
but the Cuban volante cannot upset. Two ladies are in
the vehicle, and as they sweep by they glance curiously
at the tethered horse. An instant later they are gone,
and the young man who emerges hastily from the bushes
and looks down the dust-veiled road emits a long, low
whistle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Juanita! And unless my usually correct vision is
deceived, her companion is my old friend Isabel Harding.
The dove and the serpent! What the deuce is the meaning
of this unholy intimacy? By heaven, Rozinante,”
mutters Ashley, as he untethers his horse and vaults into
the saddle, “the presence of Isabel Harding at Santos
augurs no good to the house of Quesada. Don Manuel
must be warned at once.” And kicking Rozinante’s
ample sides Ashley forces that amiable beast into a violent
canter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The remainder of the journey is quickly covered, and
as Jack reins up at La Quinta de Quesada, Don Manuel
comes out and greets him cordially.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome, Senor Ashley. You are quite a stranger.
We had begun to fear that the Spanish press censors
had suppressed you.” Then, dropping his voice to a
cautious undertone: “Any news from the field?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and rather good news. It is reported in Santiago
that your yacht, the Pearl of the Antilles, engaged a
Spanish ship of war yesterday, and that El Terredo,
after lying alongside, fought a desperate and winning
battle on the decks of the enemy’s vessel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bueno!” Don Quesada’s eyes light up with pleasure.
“Ah, Senor Ashley, there is a fighter after your own
American heart. If we had a thousand such men we
should drive the Spanish into the sea and off our loved
island forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was passed on the road from Santiago by your
daughter,” remarks Jack, as he sits down in front of a
brimming glass. “Will she be absent long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the entire evening. Surely you have not overlooked
the grand ball to be given to-night by the new
captain-general; a gathering of beauty and of chivalry,
to express his supreme contempt of the insignificance of
the Cuban cause,” says Don Quesada, with faint irony.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove! I had overlooked it. The senorita was
accompanied by another lady. May I inquire her name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly. She is Mrs. Isabel Harding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought so,” mutters Jack. Then:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is her business here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Harding is my guest,” replies Don Quesada,
rather curtly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has been here long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“About ten days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack stares and bites his cigar viciously. “You will
pardon my questioning, Don Quesada. Believe me, I
am not actuated by idle curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Don bows and Jack leans over and asks, earnestly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“During Mrs. Harding’s stay here has she learned anything
that would lead her to suspect that you are identified
with the movement to free Cuba?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Naturally. She is one of us,” replies the Don, dryly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One of us!” repeats Jack, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. An American, like yourself; she is an enthusiastic
adherent of the Cuban cause and is enabled to do
us much service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you have trusted her with some secrets?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is at this moment the bearer of important dispatches
to Captain Francisco Guerra.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great Scott!” Jack jumps to his feet. Don Quesada
rises with him and demands:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean that I believe Mrs. Harding to be a spy in the
employ of the Spanish government, and that you have
signed and given into her hands your own death warrant
and the utter ruin of your friends!”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a cruel blow. Don Quesada staggers under it
and sinks helplessly into his chair. Jack pours him out
a draught of wine and then paces to and fro on the
veranda, his active mind intent on some path of escape
from the desperate situation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what hour does the ball begin?” he demands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At eight, I believe,” replies Don Quesada, faintly.
He is completely crushed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is now nearly six,” muses Jack, glancing at his
watch. “And Guerra? Where was he to receive the
dispatches?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the ball.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick! Pen and paper,” requests Jack. And as Don
Quesada hurries away to comply the young man murmurs:
“There is only one chance in a thousand, but I
must take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When the stationery is brought Jack inquires: “In
what form were the dispatches sent?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a plain envelope, such as you have there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good.” Jack writes hurriedly a few moments, passes
what he has written over to Don Quesada, and commanding
simply, “Copy that,” busies himself over another
letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Quesada follows the directions without question,
but as he writes a little of hope comes into his pale face,
and he looks admiringly at Jack, with the remark: “Can
you do it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quien sabe? It’s a desperate chance.” Jack glances
approvingly at the letter which the Don has sealed, places
it in his pocket and then addresses and seals the second
letter, which he gives to the Cuban president.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must leave here at once. Where is Don Carlos?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must accompany you. You must make your way
with all haste as secretly as possible to Santiago and go
aboard the United States cruiser America. This letter
will explain all, and make you welcome. Once under
the stars and stripes you will be safe when the storm
breaks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But my daughter!” cries the Don, suddenly recollecting
the beautiful Pearl of the Antilles. Jack’s eyes grow
tender, and, gripping the older man by the hand, he
says proudly, as their eyes meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don Quesada, I love your daughter. I will answer
for her safety with my life. And now, I’m off. Remember—to
Santiago at once. Adios!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And without waiting to ascertain how his declaration
of love affects the father of his loved one, Jack springs
into the saddle and clatters away.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>PLAYING FOR HIGH STAKES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Scarcely has a third of the distance to Santiago been
covered when horse and rider realize that the pace set
is no longer compatible with the Cuban climate. As
Rozinante settles into a walk, Ashley pulls vigorously
on a fresh cigar and revolves the situation in his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Credulous fool!” he grumbles, thinking of the betrayed
Don Manuel de Quesada. “Played right into the
enemy’s hands. But wiser and greater men have been
cozened by the smiles of a beautiful woman. Besides,
he is Juanita’s father. That covers a multitude of shortcomings.
Ah, Juanita, I must indeed love thee when I
would willingly risk my valuable life in thy behalf. I
am not a hypocrite, and I confess that an absorbing
interest in my personal welfare has ever been one of my
glittering characteristics.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those papers must be recovered. But how? But I
have a mighty big job on my hands, even if Truenos
is not a Richelieu. Well, it is the pen against the sword,
and may heaven maintain the vaunted mightiness of the
pen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is something after seven o’clock when Ashley arrives
at Santiago. The first acquaintance he meets, after he
has put up his horse and proceeded toward his hotel, is
General Murillo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you are going to the ball?” remarks Ashley,
as they shake hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most assuredly General Murillo will be there. It will
be a grand affair. Senor Ashley must attend, by all
means.</p>

<p class='c011'>Senor Ashley means to be there, and he thanks General
Murillo for an offer to introduce him to a score
of the prettiest maids in Cuba. And when the general
insists upon his American friend dining with him, the
latter quickly accepts. He has no time to waste, he tells
himself, but he is much relieved when, in reply to his
query, “And Truenos, is he at the palace?” General
Murillo informs him that the captain-general has been
called to Mentos, ten miles distant, on business of an important
nature, and will probably be late in arriving at the
festivities, which will not, however, be delayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first flash of hope comes to Ashley at this intelligence,
and he dines with a lighter heart. After half an
hour of chat on commonplace topics, he manages to ask
with well-played indifference:</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what time did Truenos leave for Mentos, general?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Early this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ah, then it is not yet too late. Ashley breathes
easier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, general, you are a loyal adherent of Spain and
I am an out-and-out American. There is no chance for
an argument between us. Let me fill your glass and we
will drink a toast to all honest men and women, whether
Spaniards or Cubans.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With pleasure, Senor Ashley. To all honest men—and
women.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which does not include your amiable friend, Mrs.
Harding,” thinks Ashley, as he raises the glass to his
lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dinner finished, the two men separate, while Ashley
exchanges his travel-worn garments for an evening
dress. Half an hour later he and General Murillo leave
for the palace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a vague suspicion that I am booked for an
exciting evening,” muses Jack, as he enters the brilliantly
lighted sala of the palace and is duly presented by
Murillo.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dancing has already begun, but Terpsichore is the
last goddess he is desirous of wooing on this particular
evening. His gaze wanders solicitously about the crowded
room and rests at last upon her whom he seeks—Juanita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is simply stunning to-night,” he mutters, nervously
tugging at his mustache.</p>

<p class='c011'>And indeed Juanita is radiantly beautiful. Her dark
loveliness is set off by a bewitching gown of white; she
is fanning herself with that lazily graceful motion which
the Saxon cannot imitate successfully, and at the moment
that Ashley discovers her she is telling Captain Ramon
Huerta, who has requested with Spanish extravagance
“the exquisite honor and incomparable delight of a figure
with her,” that she really does not care to dance this
evening. At which Captain Huerta looks disappointed
and scowls a trifle. But he continues to inflict upon her
a presence which is palpably unwelcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita’s eyes light up with unfeigned pleasure when
Ashley arrives upon the scene and she greets him with
unreserved cordiality. She presents him to Captain
Huerta, who bows as stiffly as he holds his revolver arm.
Ashley returns the salute with a suspicion of exaggeration,
and grins maliciously when the Spaniard takes himself
off, after bestowing a glance of unmistakable enmity
upon the American.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita gazes after the retreating form with distinct
aversion. “I have a strange fear of that man,” she confides
to Ashley, who smiles reassuringly and tells her
that while she is in his vicinity there should be no such
word as fear in her bright lexicon of youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita rewards this gallant speech, which from anyone
except Jack Ashley would sound boastful, with a glance
that sets the American’s blood tingling. But he has no
time to-night for love-making, whether his suit be favored
or hopeless, and as he drops into a chair beside the Pearl
of the Antilles he asks casually: “Where is your friend,
Mrs. Harding?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, you know Isabel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You passed me this afternoon on the road to Santos,
whither I was proceeding to pay my most humble respects.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then that horse by the big royal palm was yours?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even so. I was close by, but your volante swept
past at such a pace that I hardly recovered from my
surprise at seeing you before you were gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry we started away so early,” Juanita says,
regretfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So am I,” Ashley thinks, grimly, but he does not tell
her why.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen nothing of Mrs. Harding since I arrived,”
he remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita’s glance wanders about the room. “There she
is,” she indicates, “over by the staircase, the object of
the devoted attentions of Count Gonzaga.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who the deuce is Count Gonzaga?” wonders Ashley,
and he intimates as much to his companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you not met the count? General Jacinto de
Gonzaga is his military title. He is some sort of an
assistant secretary of war and is representing the home
government in Cuba for a short time. He seems desperately
smitten with Isabel. She is very handsome, do
you not think so, Senor Ashley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, very,” replies Jack, absently. He is watching
the pair by the staircase, and wondering what sort of a
game Isabel Harding is now playing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is coming this way,” says Juanita. “Have you
met her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not had that pleasure,” Ashley replies, unblushingly.
“Not lately,” he mentally adds.</p>

<p class='c011'>He turns away to admire some flowers and soon he
hears Juanita’s voice: “Isabel, allow me to present Mr.
Ashley to you. Mr. Ashley, Mrs. Harding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley turns calmly and the two are face to face. She
acknowledges the introduction with a composure equal
to Ashley’s own, and that young man permits a trace
of admiration to mingle with the expression in his eyes
which plainly says to the woman before him: “I know
your game, my lady.” And the answering flash from the
midnight orbs is: “You have more than a match in me,
Mr. Ashley. Beware!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall see,” thinks Ashley, and then, led by Juanita,
who sees nothing of the mutual recognition, the conversation
drifts into the usual chatter of the ball-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You remember, Isabel, that big horse we saw lunching
so contentedly by the road this afternoon?” prattles
Juanita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, dear, and how we wondered whether its owner
was enjoying a siesta in the bushes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, it was Mr. Ashley’s horse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw you flit by,” supplements Ashley, “but I was
back drinking at a spring and your volante was out of
sight before I had recovered from my surprise at seeing
you.” He is looking directly at Mrs. Harding and that
lady smiles, a bit ironically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I presume that when you saw the principal attraction
of El Valle de Bosque Cillos being borne toward
Santiago, you mounted your horse and sadly followed,”
ventures Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I knew the senorita was in good company,” Jack
responds, dryly, “so I continued on to Santos and spent
a profitable hour with Don Quesada.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” Mrs. Harding regards him narrowly from between
her half-dropped eyelids.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say profitable,” continues Ashley, “as I did not
know, until so informed, that Don Quesada numbered
the charming Mrs. Harding in his list of acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you congratulated him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most assuredly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The half-veiled contempt expressed in Isabel’s face
exasperates Ashley. Hidden somewhere in that corsage,
against which beats the falsest heart in Cuba, are papers
that mean the ruin of the innocent girl at his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>He must have time to think, think, think. So he
excuses himself and leaves the crowded ball-room for
a walk in the cool air of the garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>In one corner of the spacious inclosure he finds a little
arbor, and in this nook Ashley sits and smokes and thinks,
but no plan for the confusion of the adventuress suggests
itself, unless, as he growls vindictively, he abducts or
chloroforms her.</p>

<p class='c011'>His meditations are disturbed by voices close at hand.
Two gentlemen have, like himself, forsaken the heated
ball-room for the outer air, and they pause in their stroll
within a few feet of Ashley’s retreat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack pays no attention to them until by their voices
and conversation he realizes that one of them is Captain
Julio Alvarez and the other is Count Gonzaga. “That’s
a happy combination,” he laughs softly. “They ought to
get a few more of Isabel’s friends and hold a reunion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are an excellent judge of beauty, Count Gonzaga,”
he hears Alvarez remark, with a faint sneer. “I
have been noticing your devotion to the handsome Mrs.
Harding, the widow of the enormously wealthy ship-owner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, amigo, is she not beautiful?” the count replies,
enthusiastically. He appears to be in rare spirits. “I
must ask you to congratulate me, Captain Alvarez.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have—on your excellent taste.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On more, amigo. The beautiful American has consented
to become the Countess Gonzaga.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The devil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are surprised.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather. I am surprised that a gentleman of Count
Gonzaga’s position should think of linking his name with
a lady of her character.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Por Dios! Your meaning?” cries the count, with a
flash of Castilian wrath that causes Captain Alvarez to
curse his hasty words, which must have emanated from
jealousy or something deeper. Ashley wonders what.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nothing,” Alvarez replies, carelessly. “You must
pardon my unthinking remark, count. Believe me,
I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will explain yourself to me, and at once, senor,”
declares Gonzaga, with frigid emphasis.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a silence, which Alvarez, who sees that he is
in for it, finally breaks with: “Very well, count, but I
warn you that you will regret your insistence. You will
have to excuse me now, as I have promised to dance this
next figure. Meet me at this place a quarter of an hour
hence, and I will endeavor to satisfy you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” grits Gonzaga. “I will be prompt,” and
the men separate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The fair Isabel is a star, surely,” soliloquizes Ashley.
“Who would have dreamed that she was playing her
cards for the role of a countess? Alas! Gonzaga will be
brutally undeceived by Alvarez. The latter has put his
foot in it and there is only one way out. Jupiter!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley leaps to his feet, for the inspiration of his life
has come to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By George, I have it! But will she do it?” he cries.
“She must do it. It is not her nature, still it’s a chance,
and if the fates are on the side of right Don Quesada and
the senorita are saved!”</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'>Upon his return to the ball-room Ashley is taken to
task by General Murillo. “I have been searching for you
for over half an hour,” the general assures him. “Come
over here while I introduce you to the prettiest girl in
Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Confound his kindness,” grumbles Jack, mentally,
who has no time to squander in talking nonsense with
dark-eyed senoritas. There is work to be done. But
he follows Murillo over the floor and is amused to find
himself being introduced to Juanita de Quesada, who is
the center of attraction of a group of young Santiago
swells.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Senor Ashley and I are old friends,” cries Juanita,
smiling at General Murillo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you, indeed?” remarks the general, favoring the
American with a keen glance. “Well, I will leave you
together with my blessing,” and the warrior takes himself
off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have much to tell you to-night, senorita, but at
another moment,” Ashley says, as he makes his excuses
for terminating a conversation that has hardly begun.
“I have work to do, and it means much to you,” he
explains to the pouting young lady, and leaving her
somewhat mystified and not at all pleased, he goes off to
hunt up Isabel Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>He finds the latter alone. For excellent reasons Count
Gonzaga is holding himself aloof. Captain Alvarez is
not in sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you find the atmosphere of the room close?”
he inquires, as he reaches Isabel’s side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all. I am entirely cool,” she responds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is ever so much pleasanter in the garden,” persists
Ashley, as he twists his mustache and meets her
curious glance with a smile that is amiability itself. Without
another word she rises and accepts his extended arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How delightful it is out here under the stars,” rattles
on Jack, as they emerge into the garden. “These glorious
nights almost repay one for the sweltering days.
Ah, here is an ideal summer house. You will find it as
cozy as a society darling’s boudoir. Won’t you take a
seat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Harding laughs, a trifle ironically, as she sinks
upon the wooden bench that runs around the interior.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, Mr. Ashley,” she remarks, “will you be good
enough to inform me what you have brought me out
here to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With pleasure, madam,” responds Ashley, dropping
back into his old deliberate self.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you will let your thoughts stray back about six
weeks, Mrs. Harding, you will perhaps remember that
on a certain evening I had the pleasure of relating to you
a fairy tale, to assist you in dissipating the monotony of
an attendance upon the French ball. The fairy tale
lacked the closing and most interesting chapter, you will
recall, and I requested that you supply it. ‘Not to-night,’
you protested, but you kindly promised me an interview
upon the following forenoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That promise, I regret to say, you broke with as little
ceremony as one would—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I presume,” interrupts Mrs. Harding, “that it will be
unnecessary for me to assign my reason for failing to
keep my promise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite. It would not mend matters. Now, suppose,
as the novelists say, we take up the thread of our narrative,
which was broken when I left your box at the
garden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose we do? What do you desire of me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish to possess myself of certain information in
your keeping.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Relative to that Vermont affair?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Precisely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can tell you nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me. Perhaps you mean you will tell me
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As you please, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you will,” Jack says, calmly. “Will you pardon
a cigar, Mrs. Harding? Perhaps the smoke will
keep these inquisitive mosquitoes at a distance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel laughs unpleasantly. “Do I understand you
to intimate that you will resort to force?” she inquires,
sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Assuredly; although I don’t fancy the word ‘force.’
‘Induce’ is the better term.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A truce to your euphemism, Mr. Ashley. I am curious
to learn what possible lever you can possess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall not delay the information. I have in mind a
lever whose potency you can readily appreciate. I refer
to the Count de Gonzaga.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good heavens! What do you mean?” In awed,
whispered tones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you grasp my meaning,” Jack returns, coolly.
“Or will it be necessary for me to relate another fairy tale,
concerning a beautiful woman who posed successfully
for a time as the widow of an enormously wealthy American
ship-owner?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would not dare—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would dare do several things, if the occasion for
unusual trepidity seemed to arise. Besides, the vaunted
brotherhood of man—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The vaunted brotherhood of man would lead you to
betray a defenseless woman—one who never did you
aught of harm, would it?” pants Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Mrs. Harding, consider how easily you may
avert such an unfortunate denouement. I don’t care a
rap about Count Gonzaga. Conceding your natural
charms, which are legion, the count’s affections are
undoubtedly centered in your supposed fortune. That is
usually the principal item in the matrimonial calculations
of European nobility that seeks alliance with American
beauty. As a matter of fact, I should rather enjoy seeing
Gonzaga thrown down, if you will excuse the slang.
Come. A bargain is a bargain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a silence. Isabel is presumably weighing the
situation carefully, and she disappoints Ashley by rising
and remarking: “I think I will return to the ball-room,
Mr. Ashley, if you will kindly escort me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One moment,” detains Jack. Isabel resumes her seat.
“Have you carefully considered the probable result of
your silence?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must have some powerful reason for sealing your
lips on that Raymond affair,” comments Jack; and then
he growls under his breath: “Why in thunder don’t they
come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We may as well terminate this interview. Do your
worst, Mr. Ashley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is rather theatric, Mrs. Harding,” banters Jack.
“Clever woman, this,” he thinks. “She knows I would
not be such a beastly cad as to tell her story to Gonzaga.
Ah!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Footsteps are heard approaching. They stop just
without the summer house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stay!” Ashley whispers in Isabel’s ear. “The count is
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She starts to ask, “how do you know it is he?” but
remains mute. An instant later the new arrival is joined
by another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain Alvarez!” breathes Jack, gripping Isabel’s
arm. “Not a word!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel sinks into a seat. Ashley can feel her tremble.
He tosses away his cigar and remains standing. The
silence that broods over the garden nook is broken by
Captain Alvarez, who is so near the listeners that they
could reach out and almost touch him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While I can find no objection, Count Gonzaga, to
satisfying your unfortunate demand, I would advise that
you drop this matter where it is. No good can come of
wittingly injuring your amour propre. Believe me—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain Alvarez,” interrupts the count, frigidly, “you
made a distinct accusation against the character of the
lady whom I have honored with an offer of my hand.
I demand that you retract your statement and apologize
for its utterance, or prove its truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am willing to recall my hasty words, count.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you lied?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a short but eloquent silence. “Very well,” says
Alvarez. “I perceive that you are determined to be
wholly undeceived as to the imposition which has been
put upon you. Know then that the wealthy American
widow, Isabel Harding, is neither wealthy nor a widow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a widow?” repeats Count Gonzaga. “Caramba!
What, then, is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What you will,” replies Alvarez, indifferently. “What
usually is an adventuress?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the proof? Dios! The proof?” demands the
count. Perchance Alvarez is lying to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A low, unpleasant laugh from the latter. “I had the
honor of being at one time the very good friend of
madam,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Scoundrel!” grits Ashley in Mrs. Harding’s ear. The
critical moment is at hand. “Victory!” murmurs Jack,
as Mrs. Harding, who has risen and is twisting her lace
handkerchief into shreds, gasps once or twice as Alvarez
finishes his brutal story, and then faints in Ashley’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“El Diablo!” the latter hears the count ejaculate, and
with the mortification in his voice is mingled much of
mental relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather indelicate, but when a life is at stake delicacy
must go by the board,” mutters Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, the precious papers! Now, my lady, we will part
company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fanfare of trumpets in the ball-room announces
that the captain-general has at last arrived to grace the
festivities with his presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you quite recovered?” Ashley asks Isabel, with
as much solicitude in his voice as he can command.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, thank you. You see I am yet a woman,” she
says bitterly. And she adds in tones of intense hatred:
“The cur! The coward! But come, let us return to the
ball—”</p>

<p class='c011'>They have reached the entrance of the ball-room. Mrs.
Harding stops and favors Ashley with the kindest look
she has ever bestowed upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Ashley, you are no friend of mine. In fact, you
are the only man I have ever feared. But I know you
would not have been the coward that Capt. Alvarez has
proved.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s response is an enigmatic smile. He remarks,
lightly: “I have the honor of wishing you a very good-evening,
Mrs. Harding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He watches her disappear in the crowd and sees her
a few moments later in the long line that is passing the
“reviewing stand.” As she pauses an instant before the
captain-general Ashley notes the latter incline his head
slightly. Some words are spoken and Mrs. Harding continues
on.</p>

<p class='c011'>A triumphant smile flits over Ashley’s face; he thinks
exultingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The pen wins this time! Now for Juanita!”</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'>“You are in unusually good spirits this evening, Senor
Ashley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am always happy when I am near you, senorita,” is
Jack’s fervent response. At which speech, the warmest
she has ever heard from his lips, Juanita grows as rosy
as the morn and does not appear displeased.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that dreadfully important work which has occupied
so much of your time this evening yet finished?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very nearly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you can devote a little time to your friends?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am ready to devote the remainder of my existence
to one of them, senorita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what unselfishness! When do you expect to
begin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whenever I have reason to believe that such devotion
will be rewarded by—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Reward? Then it is not a bit unselfish and does not
deserve encouragement,” interrupts the young lady, with
a toss of her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are cruel, senorita,” murmurs Ashley, but his
voice does not betray a great deal of grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am just,” declares Juanita. “While I have been
sitting here at the mercy of a lot of frightfully stupid men,
you have devoted your time to the entertainment of Mrs.
Harding. Perhaps that was the devotion you alluded to
a moment ago,” ventures the young lady, with a pretty
frown.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly,” laughs Jack. “You do not know Mrs. Harding,
senorita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps not as well as you, Senor Ashley. My opportunities
have not been so good. I saw you come in
from the garden. One would hardly judge that you had
met her only half an hour ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the fair Isabel and I are old friends,” Ashley
remarks, serenely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed? Yet you told me—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you more, senorita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t want to hear any more,” opposes Juanita
crossly. “You have deceived me once and I—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Deceived thee? Ah, Juanita—” Jack checks himself
as he notes the flush of annoyance in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello! There’s the chap I’ve been looking for,” suddenly
remarks Ashley, as he catches a glimpse of Capt.
Guerra over by the big staircase. “Will you pardon me
just a moment, senorita? That will complete my evening
work, and then if a lifetime of devotion will—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop! I shan’t hear another word,” breaks in Juanita,
imperiously. “And you need not hurry back,” she adds
irritably, provoked by Ashley’s serenity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile Ashley is telling himself that he must be
progressing in his wooing, since Juanita has betrayed
symptoms of jealousy. “Devotion? She little knows how
much need she has of a clear head and strong arm,” he
thinks. “Ah, Capt. Guerra,” he remarks, pausing before
a distinguished-appearing gentleman who is idling by the
staircase, “will you be good enough to follow me into the
garden?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley passes out and Guerra follows him curiously.
When they are alone and unobserved Ashley takes an envelope
from his pocket and presses it into the captain’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read that and then destroy it,” he directs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your meaning, senor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No explanation is necessary. I am ignorant of the
contents of the documents further than that their publicity
would be deuced awkward for you and incidentally for
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wonderful! How came you by them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is my affair, senor. Had I not rescued them
they would now be in the hands of Truenos. Adios!”
And Jack leaves the mystified Spaniard to his own devices.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime a little scene that would afford Ashley the
keenest delight to witness is taking place in one of the
rooms of the palace. Gen. Truenos is seated at a table
littered with maps and papers and Gen. Murillo and Isabel
Harding have just been ushered into the apartment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have succeeded?” Truenos asks as Mrs. Harding
approaches.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beyond expectation. Quesada may not be the head
and front of the offenders, but he is certainly one in
whom there has been placed some authority.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quesada is now a fugitive,” asserts Truenos.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed?” This is news to Isabel. “Ashley’s warning,”
she thinks. “When did you learn this, general?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-day. He has taken refuge on board the United
States cruiser. I have strongly suspected Quesada, but
have not particularly feared him. Quesada is a figurehead.
What I want is proof of conspiracy on the part of
men any one of whom is more troublesome than a dozen
Quesadas—men I suspect to be conspiring against the
government even while pretending to serve it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would certain dispatches from Don Quesada addressed
to Capt. Francisco Guerra furnish the necessary
evidence?” asks Mrs. Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! You have intercepted such?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better. I am the bearer of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Truenos regards his spy admiringly. “Bueno! The
papers at once!” he cries.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And my reward?” suggests Isabel, as she takes from
her bosom the precious envelope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything that you may ask—in reason,” replies the
captain-general, reaching impatiently for the documents.
“Why, how is this? This letter is addressed to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To you?” exclaims Isabel in astonishment. “Surely—why—there
must be some mistake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Evidently,” rejoins Truenos, as he breaks the seal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel watches him anxiously as he scans the document.
A pale sickly light is beginning to break upon her bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley! The papers have been tampered with! It was
for that he led her to the garden. How did he know, before
they spoke, who were the two men whose meeting
had interrupted their conversation in the summer house?
And, oh, how weak she had been! She sees it all now and
she swears she will be revenged. Aha! She knows where
to wound him, to repay him in awful torture for the trick
he has played upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>While these dark thoughts are flitting through her
mind the captain-general has finished his brief examination
of the letter, which he tosses over to her. She picks
it up mechanically and reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“To His Excellency, Honorato de Truenos: Indisposition
prevents my attending the grand ball to-night and offering my
congratulations upon your safe arrival at Santiago. Under
the directions of such a general there should be no difficulty
in quickly subduing the insurrection, which I believe to be
nearly at an end.</p>
<div class='c017'>Manuel de Quesada.”</div>

<p class='c016'>“I have been tricked, Gen. Truenos,” says Isabel,
crushing the paper in her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would seem so,” remarks the captain-general. It is
apparent that he is vastly disappointed. “Come, tell me
of your stay at the quinta, all you know concerning Quesada
and his movements.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is much of importance to relate, and when Mrs.
Harding has finished her story Truenos summons Capt.
Huerta.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take a dozen of your men and repair at once to La
Quinta de Quesada. You know where it is?” Capt.
Huerta knows perfectly. “Ransack the house thoroughly
and fetch me every scrap of writing upon the premises.
Gen. Murillo, do you follow in the morning and
look over the place. Go!” to Huerta.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter bows and leaves the room. Mrs. Harding
follows. “One moment, Captain Huerta,” she says.</p>

<p class='c011'>A short but earnest conversation ensues. Isabel talks
in rapid whispers, and the Spanish captain listens eagerly,
while surprise, anger, hope and malicious joy are mirrored
in succession upon his swarthy countenance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Within ten minutes,” he breathes, and hurries away
to execute the commands of the captain-general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you it would be better if you delivered the
papers to me during the afternoon,” General Murillo
tells Mrs. Harding, after Truenos has gone. “Who has
been the cause of your undoing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel tells him of her suspicions, which she has come
to regard as virtual facts, and Murillo is inclined to
agree with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The game is not yet played out, general,” flashes
Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, take care, take care,” admonishes Murillo, as
they separate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, here is the very man now,” frowns the general,
as he re-enters the sala grande and is greeted by Ashley,
who has just left Captain Guerra.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Senor Ashley,” he observes dryly, “let me
give you a piece of advice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With pleasure, general. I am always open to kindly
counsel, although I do not always follow it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not let your interest in a young lady lead you
into mixing with the affairs of a country toward which
you are expected to maintain a strict neutrality,” is Murillo’s
blunt remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t think I catch your drift, general,” drawls
Jack. But he does, and the gleam of quiet triumph in his
blue eyes irritates Murillo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have warned you,” says the latter, and turns on his
heel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I am suspected,” thinks Ashley. “I imagined the
fair Isabel would like to know to whom to ascribe her
confusion. And now to undeceive Juanita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Juanita is not to be found. There are few guests
remaining in the sala and she is not among them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley explores the garden, with like success. Then
he questions the line of volante drivers drawn up before
the entrance to the palace grounds. Have any of them
seen Senorita de Quesada? None that he interrogates
have had that pleasure, and the Pearl of the Antilles is
known by sight to nearly all of them. Ashley is in
despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Senorita de Quesada?” queries one of the Cuban
jehus, who has just joined the group. “The senorita and
another lady were driven away in a volante not ten minutes
ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In what direction?” demands Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Santos.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Santos? Heavens, man, they cannot go to Santos
at this hour of night unescorted!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Unescorted? Is not Captain Huerta and his men all
the escort that one could desire?</p>

<p class='c011'>This intelligence is a frightful strain upon Ashley’s
composure, as he thinks of Juanita, Isabel, Captain
Huerta and the deserted La Quinta de Quesada.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick! To Santos!” he cries, springing into a volante
and tossing a handful of coin to the driver. “To Santos
as fast as your horse will travel!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man leaps to his seat, cracks his whip and they
are off.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they clatter through the streets of Santiago and
swing into the road which Ashley traversed only a few
hours before, Jack shouts impatiently, “Faster! Faster!
Great Scott! This is no funeral! Though it may be,
before I’m through with it,” he adds, savagely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But senor, we will dash the volante to pieces,” protests
his charioteer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Inwardly chafing, but realizing the futility of impatience,
Ashley forces himself to be calm. It seems an age
before the distance to Santos is traversed, but finally the
outlines of the few buildings which the hamlet boasts are
seen against the starlit sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>The driver reins up his steed for further directions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To La Quinta de Quesada,” orders Ashley, and they
rattle on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly rings out the command, “Alto!” and the
volante stops with a suddenness that nearly unseats its
passenger, directly in front of El Calabozo de Infierno,
the local carcel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What in the devil’s name—” begins Ashley, but he
is seized and dragged roughly from the volante, a pistol
clapped to his head and the command hissed in his ear:
“Callese!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lights appear about the entrance of the carcel, and as
Ashley is hustled toward the gloom beyond he sees,
standing near the passageway and watching the strange
proceedings with a troubled face, the aged priest whom
he noted at La Quinta de Quesada a few days before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley is hurried through the patio and along the ill-smelling
corridor beyond to an open cell. Into this he
is pushed and his ungentle captor tells him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“En la manana muere V. sobre el garrote!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” says Ashley. His stock of Spanish is
just sufficient to enable him to comprehend the nature
of the cheerful intelligence, which is to the effect that he
is to die by the iron collar to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you leave the light?” he requests.</p>

<p class='c011'>The smoky lantern is set upon the floor. Then the
door clangs to, there is a rattle of chains and the echo
of departing footsteps and he is alone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XLIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>EL CALABOZO DE INFIERNO.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>An ordinary man, suddenly placed in the position in
which Jack Ashley finds himself, would perhaps exhaust
his strength in useless imprecations upon his oppressors,
and finish by sinking into utter hopelessness as to his
fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as was intimated when the reader first made his
acquaintance, Jack Ashley is not an ordinary man. The
practice of self-restraint has enabled him to retain to a
remarkable degree his self-possession at more than one
exciting moment, and his sublime confidence in himself
is never wanting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Clearly his arrest has been arbitrary and unofficial.
He has not even been searched. His watch and money,
his papers, even his revolver, are upon his person.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And best of all, they have not deprived me of this
incomparable solace,” he says, as he draws a cigar from
his pocket and lights it at the smoky little lantern in the
cell. Then he throws himself on the wretched straw
couch, to think of some way out of the snare into which
he has stumbled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel Harding has undoubtedly imparted to Truenos
all she knows, all she suspects. But suspicion is not
proof. And the strongest suspicion would not have warranted,
much less likely have caused, such an outrage
upon a citizen of the United States.</p>

<p class='c011'>Plainly there is some private villainy back of it all.
Then a light flashes through his brain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita! In his selfish though natural consideration
of his own unpleasant position he has forgotten for the
nonce the Pearl of the Antilles, the one woman who has
ever stirred his light heart to a love that, once given,
means all of life to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He sees it all now. Don Quesada gone, his daughter
unprotected, worse than unprotected as the companion
of Isabel Harding, and at the mercy of Captain Raymon
Huerta, who has haunted her for weeks and forced his
unwelcome attentions upon her! The only man who
could lend a defending arm locked fast in a Cuban jail,
with the prospect of being garroted before another sun
goes down!</p>

<p class='c011'>It is infamous! Ashley leaps to his feet and paces the
cell like a raging lion, and shakes the iron door with
impotent energy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pshaw!” he cries, and laughs recklessly. “What is
the use in wasting my strength and nerves in this manner?
Courage, Jack. If the senorita is to be saved,
and yourself incidentally, you will need all of your
strength and nerve. Let’s take an account of stock.”
And he falls to meditating again.</p>

<p class='c011'>How come Captain Huerta and his men to be at Santos
at this hour of the night? Sent by Truenos, who perhaps
has ordered Don Quesada’s arrest, or, if he knows of
the latter’s flight, has ordered the quinta to be searched.
How came Juanita to leave for home without bidding
him adios? She could not have been so piqued by jealousy
or by his good-natured banter that she would have
left the palace without even a cold farewell. Isabel’s
work, without a doubt. Why has he been set upon by a
horde of ruffians and thrust into a cell? Because his
presence at Santos would interfere with some devilish
plans afoot. Again Isabel’s work, assisted by Captain
Huerta.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what vile plot is maturing outside the walls of
El Calabozo de Infierno while he lies helpless here? As
he thinks of Juanita he grits his teeth in suppressed fury
and chews his cigar to a pulp.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for his captor’s gratuitous information, that he is
to be executed in the morning, nonsense! That is what
an American would term a cold bluff. They would not
dare to proceed to such an extremity. They have gone
to dangerous lengths already.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment his meditations are broken in upon by
a key being inserted in the cell door. The door swings
open and closes behind Father Hilario, the venerable
padre of the little church of San Pedro. At sight of the
priest, Ashley’s composure returns.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-morning, father,” is his salutation. “I noticed
you at the entrance to my lodgings for the night, and I
should have spoken, but my friends rather insisted on
my maintaining a strict silence. I believe ‘callese’ means
keep your mouth shut, or something of that sort, does
it not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have but a short time to remain,” says Father Hilario,
surveying with some wonder the composed face of
the young man before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, whatever your errand may be, I am indebted
to you for this visit,” remarks Jack. “It’s confoundedly
lonesome here. I will not apologize for my apartment,
as it is not of my own selection. Now, what can I do for
you, father, or what can you do for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My son, you are not of the faith of Rome, but I have
called to offer you the consolation which a clergyman
can extend in your last hours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it as bad as that? Really, I don’t take any stock
in this garroting business. I believe that is thrown in for
theatrical effect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Hilario shakes his head. “Captain Huerta
is a desperate man,” he avows. “There is nothing to
prevent his wreaking his enmity upon you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, is there not? Thank you, father, for the offer of
your ministrations, but really, I do not believe I shall
need them. Do not misunderstand me,” Ashley adds,
quickly, as a pained expression passes over the kindly
face of the priest. “What I mean is that I have too
healthy an interest in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
to pass many hours in such a stuffy, ill-smelling
donjon as this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Hilario holds up a warning finger. “There are
listeners about,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let them listen. If their stock of English is equal
to my collection of Spanish they will be vastly entertained
by my remarks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will attempt to escape?” queries the priest, in a
cautious whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The attempt will fail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will succeed,” retorts Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; it will fail,” repeats Father Hilario. “The carcelero,
always watchful, will be doubly vigilant to-night.
He has probably been bribed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But a larger bribe—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is out of the question. His life would pay the
penalty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe it. But enough of that,” says Ashley,
impatiently. “Now tell me, father, of the Senorita de
Quesada. Have you seen her to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The priest is silent. In his muteness, Ashley finds the
confirmation of his worst fears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak, man!” he cries impatiently. “Do you know
that the life and happiness of the senorita are more to me
than my own existence? Speak!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is in the church of San Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In whose company?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alone in the church of San Pedro after midnight?
What mean you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is a prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A prisoner? Ten thousand devils!” rages Ashley,
striding to and fro in his narrow cell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Calm yourself, my son,” remonstrates Father Hilario.
“Nothing can be accomplished by such wild outbursts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes; I’ll be calm!” grits Ashley. “By heaven, I’d
give ten years of my life for ten minutes of liberty!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come. Time flies, and the carcelero will soon be
here,” admonishes Father Hilario. “Is there aught I
can do for thee, my son?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley forces a tranquillity of mind that he little feels.
“How came you to learn of the senorita’s imprisonment?”
he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was returning from a midnight summons to a deathbed
and had nearly reached my house when Captain
Huerta and his men entered the town, escorting a volante.
Suddenly the party were attacked in the darkness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Huerta’s own men?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was doubtless part of the plot. The two women
in the volante were separated. The senorita was borne
fainting into the church and then quietness reigned again.
I lingered about the scene, and was a witness of your
arrest not many minutes afterward. I begged permission
to see you, and the carcelero, in granting it, bade me
roughly to tell you that you die on the morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A merry knave,” remarks Ashley. “Well, father, you
can be of great service to me. Will you not bear a message
from me to General Truenos? Or, no; hang Truenos.
To General Murillo, then. You know him. My
detention here is without his knowledge, of that I am
assured. It is a vile outrage that he would not brook.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The priest shakes his head. “It would be useless,” he
says. “From the instant I leave this place I shall be
watched, shadowed every step of the way to my house.
An attempt to leave Santos would be at once frustrated.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You believe so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am positive of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the senorita. Can you communicate with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay; and without the knowledge of Captain Huerta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can?” cries Ashley, eagerly. “But you said you
would be watched.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah,” says the priest, with a faint smile, “there is an
entrance to the church that Captain Huerta knows not
of—an entrance from my house through the little garden
intervening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. Excellently good,” remarks Ashley, into
whose active brain has flashed an inspiration. “Father
Hilario, I have a plan. You must join the senorita and
myself in marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marry you? Impossible!” exclaims the astonished
padre. Have the American’s troubles driven him insane?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible nothing. Easiest thing in the world if the
lady is willing,” is Ashley’s cheerful response. “Now,
listen to me, father. Don Quesada is a fugitive, and his
daughter, being a Cuban, is amenable to the laws of this
country. From the Spanish government she would not
likely receive much earnest protection or reparation for
any wrongs she might suffer. But when she becomes
Mrs. Jack Ashley,” says Jack, dramatically, working up
to a mild enthusiasm, “she is then an American citizen
and as such she will be under the protection of a flag
that the Spaniard dare not affront with impunity. You
get the idea, eh?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Impossible, impossible, I tell you,” repeats Father
Hilario. “You are not a Catholic, Senor Ashley; the
senorita is. Besides, the consent of her father—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is no time for quibbling over technicalities.
Would you see a woman, your friend’s daughter, insulted,
perhaps murdered, when a few words from your lips
would save her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would do my duty,” replies the priest, calmly. “The
idea is madness. I cannot bring the senorita here, and
you cannot reach the church.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll be there in season,” is the cool response.
“Just leave the way from your house to the church open
to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you have any message to send the senorita, you
must make haste,” adjures the priest. “The carcelero is
approaching.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be brief,” replies Ashley. Then hurriedly:
“Go to her at once. Comfort her. Pray with her. And
tell her that I will be with her before the sun rises. Say
nothing about the marriage. I prefer to do my own proposing.
But, above all, remain with her until I come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, in a different tone, as the cell door is swung
open by the carcelero: “Many thanks, dear father, for
your kindly visit and spiritual solace. I have made my
peace with heaven, and to-morrow I will show these
Spanish gentry how an American can die—when he gets
ready,” he adds, under his breath, as the iron door clangs
to and he is once more alone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER L.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>AT BAY IN THE CHURCH OF SAN PEDRO.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>As the echo of Father Hilario’s footsteps dies away
adown the gloomy corridor Ashley glances at his watch.
It lacks a quarter of two o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The trick must be done within two hours, or all is
lost,” he mutters. Then he extinguishes the light and
throws himself down upon the pallet of straw.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten, fifteen minutes pass. The tread of the carcelero
on his rounds sounds from the corridor and a light is
flashed into the cell. A counterfeit snore from Ashley
greets him and he passes on with a muttered “Dios! He
sleeps as if to-morrow were his wedding day.” In five
minutes, his round of inspection completed, he repasses
the cell door and continues on, until silence again enshrouds
the prison.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Ashley arises, takes out his jack-knife and opens
one of the blades, a finely tempered steel saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank heaven for that much Yankee inventiveness!”
he murmurs, as he sinks on one knee beside the iron door
of his cell and applies the saw blade to the lower end of
one of the rusty bars.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the steel slowly but surely eats its way into the corroded
iron and finally slips entirely through, Ashley again,
aided by a match, consults his watch. It is nearly three
o’clock. Scarcely had he extinguished the lucifer than
the approach of the carcelero is heard, and he retreats to
his pallet, to again feign an audible slumber.</p>

<p class='c011'>All still once more, and he attacks the upper end of
the bar. When almost severed he seizes it with both
hands and exerts all his strength. The iron snaps, and as
Ashley falls back the bar slips from his hands and drops
to the floor of the cell with a loud clang.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack inwardly curses his carelessness. Such a tremendous
noise would alarm the sleepiest of guards. He must
act, and act quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>To squeeze through the space made in the door is the
work of some moments, and it is not accomplished an
instant too soon. A light approaches.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley remembers that opposite his cell is another, the
door to which is ajar. With the iron bar in his hand he
gropes his way across the corridor and into the open
cell. A moment later the carcelero, lantern in hand,
stands before the now tenantless pen, and stares stupidly
at the wreck of the iron door.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he can utter an outcry the bar in Ashley’s hand
descends upon his head with crushing force and he drops
like a log.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope I didn’t kill the poor devil,” thinks Jack. He
drags the unconscious man into the open cell, and, tearing
and tying his handkerchief into a gag, he makes
assured the silence of the carcelero. Then he extinguishes
the lantern and is soon standing at the entrance
of the prison.</p>

<p class='c011'>To his left is life and liberty. To his right—ah, something
dearer than life—Juanita de Quesada, locked in the
little church of San Pedro, the outlines of which stand
boldly against the star-gemmed heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within that little sanctuary the altar lamp sheds a soft
light over a strange picture. Juanita is lying upon the
steps of the altar, her head buried in her arms, and near
by stands Father Hilario, his arms folded, gazing compassionately
upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why does he not come?” moans the girl, lifting her
head and looking at the priest with tear-stained eyes
from which hope has not yet fled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Hilario is silent. The American does not come
because, forsooth, he cannot leave his prison. But why
undeceive the girl? Let her hope on to the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>The opening of a door behind them causes both to start.
Jack Ashley stands upon the threshold, a smile upon his
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a glad cry Juanita runs to him and takes both
his hands. “I was expecting you,” she says, simply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you. And you?” asks Ashley, turning to
Father Hilario.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bore your message. I did not expect you,” replies
the priest, regarding the young man with mingled wonder
and admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you must have a more flattering opinion of the
security of Cuban jails than I. And now, senorita, tell
me how you come to be in this unhappy position.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The story is brief, but interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Five minutes after you left me in the ball-room at the
palace,” narrates Juanita, “Isabel came to me and declared
that we should leave for Santos. She explained that Captain
Huerta and his men were going to Santos at once,
and would escort us, and that the ride would be enjoyable
after the heat and excitement of the ball. At the mention
of Captain Huerta I know I looked displeased, and Isabel
remarked disagreeably: ‘Perhaps you would prefer the
escort of Mr. Ashley.’ I replied that I should certainly
prefer it to that of Captain Huerta, and she declared that
you would not be likely to offer it, as—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As what?” asks Ashley, as Juanita pauses in confusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She gave me to understand that you had proposed to
her that night and that she had refused you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you believed her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know what I believed. But I agreed to Isabel’s
proposition and we left for Santos at once. On
our arrival there we were set upon by a party of men.
All I remember is being lifted from the volante by Captain
Huerta. Then I fainted, and when I recovered consciousness
I was in the church, alone with Captain Huerta.
He told me that he loved me. I replied that I hated
him, and when he attempted to put his arm around me
I struck him in the face. Then he swore frightfully and
told me I would regret the blow. ‘My father—’ I
began. ‘Your father is a fugitive,’ he sneered. ‘You are
wholly in my power.’ ‘Then I will kill myself,’ I cried.
‘Oh, no; you will come to your senses in a few hours,’
he said, tauntingly. ‘I shall expect to find you in a better
humor when I return.’ Then he went away, locking the
church door behind him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When he had gone I piled all the furniture of the
church against the door and then threw myself down
before the altar and prayed. The opening of a door
aroused me. I lifted my head, expecting to see again
the hated face of Captain Huerta. Instead, to my great
joy, I beheld Father Hilario. When he told me of your
arrest I cried out in terror. Then he gave me your message
and hope came to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Satan came also,” quotes Ashley. “I fear your
barricade would not withstand a very earnest assault,”
surveying the rude defense critically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was all I could do. But tell me of yourself,” urges
Juanita. “What is the meaning of your violent arrest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley unfolds the black plot, beginning with the
first appearance of the adventuress at La Quinta de Quesada,
the Cuban girl grows very pale, and she realizes
how much she owes to the blue-eyed young man who
finishes his story with the smiling quotation: “And now,
senorita, if a lifetime of devotion—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, do not remind me of my folly,” she protests,
choking back a sob. “I will never doubt you again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus encouraged, Ashley takes both of Juanita’s hands
and whispers very tenderly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this darkest hour before the dawn I have found
the courage to tell you what has been in my heart for—for
nearly three weeks,” he finishes with a smile. Even
amid the dangers that surround them, the humor of his
declaration impresses him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A wave of crimson spreads over the girl’s face, and in
the big black eyes Ashley sees the light of a great love.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young people’s eyes meet in mutual understanding.
He draws her to him, and the first kiss of love is exchanged.
It must be followed by many others, for Father
Hilario, after waiting what he considers a reasonable
length of time, turns to the pair with an uneasy: “Well,
what is all this leading up to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A marriage, I should say,” replies Jack, cheerfully.
“That is usually the logical outcome of such a situation.”
Father Hilario bites his lips impatiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The church and the pastor are here, and I think the
bride is willing,” continues Jack. The young girl gives
the priest an anxious look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is useless to argue that matter further,” is the firm
reply. “My duty to the church forbids.” The priest’s
face convinces Ashley that the debate on the matrimonial
question is closed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we must seek elsewhere for a clergyman,” he
remarks, coolly. “Come, Juanita.” And he leads her
toward the little door by which he entered the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is madness!” cries the priest, barring the way.
“The town is overrun with your enemies. It is nearly
day and the place is already astir. Hark! Do you not
hear the tread of feet in the street?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spanish or no Spanish, I don’t propose to remain here
and be trapped like a rat,” declares Ashley. “We can
at least make a break for liberty. I do not—”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of a key being tried in the church door
cuts short his words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is Captain Huerta,” whispers Juanita, and she trembles
like a leaf in Jack’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick, father!” commands the latter. “You reconnoiter
and see if the way through the garden and your
house is clear.” The venerable padre hurries away and
Ashley improves the opportunity to shower kisses upon
Juanita’s cold and unresponsive lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a man you are!” she murmurs. “I believe you
would make love on your way to execution.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should if the opportunity was offered,” laughs Jack,
softly. “What could more brightly illumine the last
moments of a condemned man than to hold in his arms,
if but for a few minutes, so much loveliness?”</p>

<p class='c011'>At that moment Father Hilario reappears. “There is
no hope,” he reports. “Suspecting all was not right,
Captain Huerta has surrounded the church and grounds
with his men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then fasten that door,” says Jack. “An attack at
one end is all I care to look after.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bolt is shot into place, and with the click comes
the sound of muttered oaths from without, followed by a
savage kick at the barricaded portal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, there, within!” demands an impatient voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sound of the hateful tones Juanita shudders and
throws her arms about Ashley’s neck. “Save me from
that man!” she whispers.</p>

<p class='c011'>For answer Jack takes another reef in his confidence-restoring
arm, and draws his revolver.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t move, dear,” he murmurs, solicitously. He
rather enjoys the tight embrace of those soft arms, to
which terror has lent a delightful fervency. “You need
not fear Captain Huerta so long as there is light enough
to shoot by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a strange tableau that the altar lamp dimly shows.
The three figures stand immovable, as if carved in stone.
Ashley is calm, resolute, and his eyes are fixed upon the
barricaded door. The resignation of despair is depicted
in the beautiful face of the Cuban girl; her eyes seek
those of her lover, her head upon his breast. They will
at least die together. Near by stands the aged priest,
his arms folded, his eyes turned heavenward and his lips
moving as if in prayer. The tread of soldiery and the
rattle of steel sound from the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stillness within the church is broken only by a
sharp click as Ashley’s revolver is brought to half-cock.</p>

<p class='c011'>The seconds drag by. Every one of them seems an
hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there is the sound of a rush of feet without, followed
by a loud crash, as the church door is hurled from
its fastenings and piled upon the debris of the barricade.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gap thus made throngs with Spanish soldiery, at
their head, sword in hand, Captain Raymon Huerta. At
sight of the picture within the church he starts back with
a cry of surprise and a choice assortment of Castilian
imprecations.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You here, dog of an Americano? Who opened to
thee the doors of the carcel?” And the Spanish captain
glowers around upon his followers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am indebted to no one except myself for my escape
from your infernal den,” replies Ashley; and he adds,
sternly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hark ye, Captain Raymon Huerta. I am here to
protect this young woman from your deviltry, to protect
her with my life. I warn you that any violence to her
will cost you yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your life is already forfeited,” sneers Huerta. Then
to his followers:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, there, men! Seize the Americano and leave the
girl to me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley’s arm comes up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halt!” he thunders. “This woman is my wife and as
such she is an American citizen. Another step, and, by
the stars and stripes, I’ll send your leader to perdition!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The streak of dawn that struggles in through the little
window above the altar glints upon the polished barrel
of a revolver pointed straight at the heart of Captain
Raymon Huerta.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>UNDER THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You lie!” shouts Captain Raymon Huerta, white with
rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley retorts calmly. “I repeat, Captain Huerta, what
I have asserted. As my wife, this woman is an American
citizen. An order from you to your men to fire upon or
seize us, will be the last words you will utter in this
world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The marriage? Impossible! The proof? The proof?”
cries Huerta, foaming with passion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley points to Father Hilario. “The proof is the
word of yonder man of God, by whom we were wedded
not an hour ago!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Huerta glowers upon the priest. “Speaks the
Americano truly?” he fumes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Hilario is silent. His eyes wander from the
lovers to the rage-distorted countenance of the Spanish
captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley holds his breath. He has made a superb bluff.
Will the priest fail him at this supreme moment?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Speak, vile dog of a priest!” snarls Huerta, the padre’s
silence adding fuel to his rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the brutal epithet Father Hilario’s cheek flushes.
Then he speaks, slowly and deliberately:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is true. They are man and wife in the sight of God,
and around them are the protecting arms of the church
of Rome.” He raises his arms as if pronouncing a benediction,
and murmurs under his breath a pious: “May
God forgive me the deception!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Huerta bites his lip till the blood comes. One
word to his men would mean the destruction of the heroic
trio. But over the shining barrel of Ashley’s revolver,
pointed straight at his heart, the Spanish captain reads,
in a pair of flashing eyes, a grim resolution that means
his death if he but raises his sword.</p>

<p class='c011'>The situation is critical. The strain is beginning to
tell on even Ashley’s steel nerves.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment a commotion is noted in the throng of
soldiery that bars the entrance to the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pushing them right and left, a tall, distinguished-looking
military man strides into the sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Don Huerta dashes his sword back into its sheath and
sullenly awaits developments.</p>

<p class='c011'>General Murillo, for the arrival is he, glances from one
of the party to the other, and then addresses himself to
Ashley:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Senor, may I ask the meaning of this warlike demonstration?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley lowers his revolver. “It means, general, that
your arrival has averted an international episode.”</p>

<p class='c011'>General Murillo turns to Huerta. “Withdraw at once,”
he commands. “I will see you anon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Captain Huerta and his men have left the church
Murillo asks:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, Senor Ashley, will you be good enough to
explain this peculiar affair?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Willingly. But first, general,” says Jack, with a faint
grin, “allow me to introduce you to the prettiest girl in
Cuba.” And for the first time since the storming of the
church door he removes his arm from about the waist of
the Pearl of the Antilles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Murillo bows with Spanish profundity. “I have the
honor of the acquaintance of the Senorita de Quesada,”
he remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is now plain Mrs. Jack Ashley,” corrects the
newspaper man. “Pardon me one moment, general,”
and he whispers to Juanita:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father Hilario looks very disconsolate; go and comfort
him. And now, general,” to Murillo, “I am at your
service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley recounts briefly the exciting events that took
place from the hour he left the ball-room until the arrival
of his auditor. He says nothing of Mrs. Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the recital progresses Murillo’s face darkens.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am convinced,” declares Ashley, in conclusion,
“that my arrest was wholly the work of that scoundrel
Huerta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what do you propose to do now?” asks Murillo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I have no special plans beyond settling accounts
with Captain Huerta.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will do the settling with Captain Huerta,” observes
the general, dryly. “As for you—you must leave Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My duty to my paper will not permit me to leave at
present. And even were I free, general, I should not
desire to be understood as running away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Murillo makes a gesture of impatience. “Just like you
Americans. You would all want to fiddle like Caesar
while Rome was burning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your pardon; but I believe Nero was the soloist on
that red-letter occasion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The general frowns. “Come with me,” he says; “I
will furnish to you the necessary papers and you may proceed
without interruption to Santiago. The cruiser America
sails for Key West to-morrow. You must take passage
on her. I do you a service, Senor Ashley, and I do
it gladly, as I have a friendship for you. But I warn you
that any delay in leaving Cuba may subject you to much
annoyance, to use no harsher term. The government
suspects you of secretly aiding the insurrection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The government is mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Murillo glances at Juanita, and smiles ironically. “Senor
Ashley,” he says, “I am not so easily deceived. The
instrumentality that saved the senorita from annoyance
is the same instrumentality that placed the traitor Quesada
in his present safe retreat. But what I as a man
might applaud, I cannot as a loyal adherent to Spain
condone; nor would the government take a sentimental
view of the matter. You will see the wisdom of my advice.
Come.” And Murillo leads the way from the church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he leaves the scene of his new-found happiness
Jack Ashley presses warmly the wrinkled hands of Father
Hilario. “Father, you’re a brick,” he says, and adds solicitously:
“Will not Captain Huerta seek to revenge himself
upon you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear him not,” replies the priest, raising his head
proudly. Then, placing the hand of Juanita within Ashley’s,
he lays a hand on the head of each, and in a voice
choked with emotion says:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My children, I have sinned for your sake, but I trust
that God will condone the offense. Heaven bless and
keep you and when you are happily sheltered in your
northern home think sometimes of Father Hilario, of the
little church of San Pedro.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Imprinting a kiss upon the brow of the Cuban girl,
the aged priest turns away and sinks upon his knees
before the crucifix over the altar.</p>

<p class='c011'>It requires but a few minutes for General Murillo to
make out the necessary passports and as he hands them to
Ashley, he remarks: “You will follow my advice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will follow it to Santiago, at least, general.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The general shrugs his shoulders. “Do as you please.
I have warned you,” he says, and turns away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ten minutes later Ashley and Juanita are en route for
Santiago in a volante.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young lady is sad. The natural reaction has set in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am thinking of my father,” she replies to Jack’s
attempt to rally her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your father is all right,” he confidently assures her.
“In an hour or two you will be in his arms, and I shall
have the pleasure of asking him for the hand of the
dearest girl in the world. Or, stay, I am progressing too
rapidly,” he muses, in mock concern. “It has occurred
to me,” he goes on, “that—oh, well, of course a proposal
of marriage must naturally be regarded more conservatively
now than—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jack!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, senorita.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of you, senorita. Ah, something in your eyes tells
me that I may be presumptuous enough to hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What nonsense! There, I knew you were joking,”
declares Juanita, as she catches a stray twinkle in Jack’s
eye. “You foolish boy, you know I love you. I have
loved you ever since—I met you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three whole weeks ago,” muses Ashley, as he draws
the blushing face to his and kisses it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know, I have been insanely jealous of your
friend Don Carlos all along,” confesses Jack, after a long,
happy silence, during which the pair quite forget the
volante driver.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jealous of Don Carlos? Oh!” cries Juanita, bursting
into merry laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I admit it is highly humorous, in the light of recent
developments,” says Jack, who sees nothing to laugh at
in his remark. “What is there so amusing in it all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you dear, foolish Jack,” exclaims the girl, throwing
her arms around his neck. “To be jealous of Don
Carlos! Why, Don Carlos is a girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am aware that, to the public gaze, Don Carlos is at
present a young lady,” returns Ashley, loftily, “but you
must remember that I knew Don Carlos before he exchanged
his customary attire for his present feminine
toggery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how superiorily wise you look,” banters Juanita.
“But I tell you that Don Carlos has always been, is now
and always will be a girl!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you never suspected it—you who are so penetrating?”
mocks the young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Jack makes no reply. His mind is attempting to
digest this surprising bit of information. Then a light
begins to break upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her real name—what is it?” he asks, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Juanita becomes serious again. “I must not divulge
it, Jack, dear. I should not have told you what I have,
but you looked so comical when you told me you had
been jealous of Don Carlos. There, please don’t catechise
me further.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall not,” replies Ashley. “Besides, it will be unnecessary
for you to betray her identity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you know—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I do. As I more than once remarked, I have
an excellent memory for faces, although I am sometimes
a dev—a diablo of a while in recalling the names that
go with them.” And Ashley relapses into meditation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, here we are at Santiago,” announces Jack. “In
a short time you can bid a temporary adieu to the soil of
Cuba; and the sooner the better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And indeed, the streets of Santiago are in apparent
possession of a riotous mob, swarming in and out of the
cafes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley and Juanita find no obstacles in their path; half
an hour later they are aboard the America, under the red,
white and blue, and Juanita is in her father’s arms, relating
breathlessly the thrilling incidents of the last few
hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley leaves them to their exchange of confidence and
affection, and goes off to talk with Captain Meade. When
he sees Don Quesada again that gentleman takes his
hand and assures him that he is honored by his prospective
entrance into the family.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for Cuba,” declares the Don, his eyes lighting with
a trace of their old-time fire, “the cause of the patriots
was never brighter. To be sure, I am a fugitive, and
El Terredo yesterday suffered a severe defeat, the Pearl
of the Antilles having been destroyed in an unequal engagement
with three Spanish cruisers and gunboats. But
General Masso is advancing upon Santiago, with 10,000
revolutionists, and the fall of the city is looked for within
forty-eight hours. Already the Spanish warships are
gathering preparatory to shelling the place should it
come into the hands of the patriots, and foreign vessels
are preparing to leave the harbor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I will take Murillo’s advice for the present,”
reflects Ashley, “but I shall return to-morrow with the
cruiser and be in at the death.” Then he goes in search of
Juanita.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” says that young lady, “if you have finished
squeezing my hand before all these officers and seamen,
come below and I will introduce you to—to ‘Miss Carlos’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, sweetheart,” replies Jack, gayly. “Let me
see. I believe you remarked early this morning that you
would never doubt me again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes?” responds the young lady, inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, after you have introduced me to ‘Miss Carlos’
will you leave us alone for a short time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a strange request! But it is granted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good. And now let us go below.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The interview, whatever its nature, has a peculiar effect
upon Ashley. Upon returning from it he is saying to
himself, sotto voce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove! This case has taken a turn that I little
looked for. I’d give four dollars to see John Barker,
detective, at this moment.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE ENCOUNTER AT THE CAFE DE ALMENDRAS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You have settled your business interests in this country
satisfactorily?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly so. Much more profitably, indeed, than I
expected.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there is nothing further to keep you here except
sight-seeing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing—except sight-seeing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton, Phillip Van Zandt and Louise Hathaway
are seated on the veranda of the little Cafe de Almendras,
on the outskirts of Santiago. They have returned this
morning from a short jaunt to the interior and are not
impressed favorably with rural Cuba. So they gladly return
to the contemplation of that view which is ever
welcome, no matter where one may roam—old ocean.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you, Miss Hathaway—have you any Cuban ties
that you will sever with regret?” inquires Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway is more thoughtful than the occasion
would seem to require. “None,” she replies, slowly.
“Unless,” she adds quickly, “the pleasure of your society
for the last month may be regarded as a Cuban tie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” rejoins Van Zandt, with a glance that
brings a blush to the face of the Vermont maiden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I am utterly, uncompromisingly disappointed
with Cuba,” she says. “And the people! But I have
been here but a few days, so I shall not place my opinion
upon record.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet your brief impression of Cuba, Miss Hathaway,
would not be likely to change much for the better
if you were to spend a dozen years here. The country is
uninteresting. The Spaniard cannot be changed. The
Cuban—that is, the Cuban we see about us—does not
deserve freedom. He lets the blacks and his brothers
of the chaparral do all the fighting, and hardly dares, except
in private, to express his cordial hatred of his ancient
enemy. Do you know, Mr. Felton, I rather fancied that
you had relatives in Cuba.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Relatives in Cuba?” The little color suddenly recedes
from Mr. Felton’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” says Van Zandt. “The day before I had the
pleasure of meeting you and Miss Hathaway I was reading
in a New York paper an interview with a member of
the Cuban revolutionary society. In speaking of the
diversified character of the Spanish officers in Cuba, the
gentleman mentioned that attached to the staff of General
Truenos was a young American, a former sugar
planter. His name was Felton, but he changed it to
Alvarez. When I first discovered your name and learned
that you were en route to Cuba I unconsciously associated
you with this young sugar planter so friendly to the Spanish
cause.”</p>

<p class='c011'>During Van Zandt’s speech, delivered in apparently
careless tones, Mr. Felton succeeds in mastering a strong
emotion. Louise is regarding him somewhat nervously,
but Van Zandt quickly refills Miss Hathaway’s glass with
jerez and passes it to her with a smiling comment on the
quality of the wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rather awkward silence is broken by Mr. Felton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Van Zandt, and to you, Louise, I may say that
I believe I have a son in Cuba, and that he is the young
man alluded to in that newspaper. One reason why I
have come to Cuba is to find that son. I supposed he was
operating the sugar plantation that we visited last week.
I did not know that he had joined the Spanish service.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I regret,” remarks Van Zandt, “that my idle remark
should have stirred you to speak of a matter on which
you might have preferred to have remained silent.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The subject is a painful one, it is true, but once started
I may as well go on to the end. It is nearly a year ago—the
1st of June—that Ralph left home, and since then
I have heard from him but twice, and vaguely each
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Both Mr. Felton and Louise are gazing seaward, else
they would note the swift look of surprise that passes
across Van Zandt’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The 1st of June,” he repeats, as if attempting to recall
some incident of the past. “Did not something peculiar
occur in Raymond—that is the name of your town, is it
not?—about that time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton shoots a quick, inquiring look at Van
Zandt’s face, but reads nothing there except disinterested
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something very peculiar occurred two days before
that date,” he replies, gravely. “On the night of Memorial
day Roger Hathaway, Louise’s father, the cashier of the
Raymond National Bank, was found dead in his office at
the bank, and the institution was discovered to have
been robbed of a large amount of money. The murderer
has never been discovered and presumably never will be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An expression of self-reproach is visible in Van Zandt’s
face as he turns to Louise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, Miss Hathaway; I was not aware—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing to forgive, Mr. Van Zandt,” Louise
replies. “But I do not share Mr. Felton’s opinion that
the veil of mystery enshrouding the tragedy will never
be lifted. Something within me tells me that one day
the slayer of my father will be brought to justice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Hathaway again turns her eyes, now wet with
tears, toward the sea. Mr. Felton is very pale and it
is apparent that he would welcome a change in the conversation.
Van Zandt, however, continues:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, that you speak of it,” he says, knitting his
brows, “I recall that I read something about the case
in the papers at the time. Was no one suspected?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three persons were suspected—two of them unjustly.
Derrick Ames”—with a quick glance at Louise, who
flushes scarlet and bites her lips—“was one and my son
the other. You may be surprised at my stating this,”
in response to Van Zandt’s questioning gaze, “but you
will understand better why I am so anxious to find Ralph.
He had some motive for leaving Raymond as he did,
and until that motive is discovered and his name cleared
I shall be one of the most unhappy of fathers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the third party suspected? You have mentioned
only two,” says Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The third? Oh, yes; the third was a young man
named Ernest Stanley. He was the only stranger in
Raymond, so far as known, on the day of the tragedy.
This young man had been liberated from state prison
on Memorial day, after serving two years of a three
years’ sentence for forgery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there was fairly good reason for suspecting
him?” comments Van Zandt, with an enigmatic smile.
“Give a dog a bad name, you know. But tell me about
the fellow. I confess I am rather interested in him. Was
his forgery a very serious affair?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A matter of $1,000. Mine was the name he forged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed. How did you trace it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was a peculiar feature of the case. Stanley
presented the check at the bank of which I was president.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather a blundering piece of business, should you
not say? But may he not have been innocent?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The forgery was proved.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! Stanley admitted it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; he told a fanciful story of the check having been
given to him in New York, in payment of a gambling
debt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing impossible in that story, Mr. Felton. I will
tell you why. A night or two before we left New York
I was seated in Madison Square garden, listening to a
concert, when a party of sporting men sat down at the
next table, and one of them entertained his companions
by relating a reminiscence of a game of draw poker in
which he had played a part two or three years before.
I will not repeat the story, but perhaps you will understand
the point I am trying to make. Four men were
playing and during the course of one hand the betting
had narrowed to two of them. A held what he believed
to be a well-nigh invincible hand. Flushed with confidence,
and irritated by his opponent’s insinuation that
he had no more money to wager, A took a check-book
from his pocket, wrote a check for $1,000 or some such
sum, and tossed it upon the table. The bet was covered,
the hands shown down, and A lost. Now,” finishes Van
Zandt, “A might not have had a dollar in the bank. He
might have put a worthless check upon the table, knowing,
as he thought he knew, that there was not one chance
in a thousand of a necessity for its payment arising.
That being the case, what mattered it whose name was
on the check, his own or—well, say his father’s? I am
only theorizing on what might naturally occur some time,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cyrus Felton’s face has become ghastly and he appears
to be on the verge of collapse. Miss Hathaway
regards Van Zandt with wonder and apprehension. The
latter seems unconscious of the effect his words have produced,
and he remarks carelessly: “But I will not discuss
the matter further, as I suspect it bores you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this instant the clatter of hoof-beats sounds from
the road, as a detachment of Spanish caballeria ride up,
tether their horses and hurry boisterously into the cafe.
The Americans are established on a quiet veranda at
the rear of the building, where they may be free from
just such interruptions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you ready to depart?” says Van Zandt to his companions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am anxious to return to Santiago as soon as possible,”
declares Mr. Felton.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt raps upon the table for the waiter, but no
response is made. Host and helpers are busily occupied
with their noisy guests.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon me a moment. I will step within and settle
the account,” says Van Zandt, as he rises and enters the
cafe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The drinking-room is crowded with the boisterous
soldiery, disporting themselves as if war were an amusement
and the curtain nearly down on the farce of revolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>The presumptive leader of the troopers is a tall, rather
handsome young fellow, who sits with his back against
the wall and a glass in his hand. There is no one within a
dozen or twenty feet of him except one caballero, with
a scar across his forehead, who sits by himself at a
table.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Van Zandt enters and closes the door behind him
the Spanish captain glances up and their eyes meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Great heavens! Am I dreaming,” mutters Van
Zandt. And then he stands with white face and clenched
fists, staring at the man before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter returns the stare. “I trust you will know
me again senor,” he remarks, ungraciously, as he sets
down his glass and strikes a match to ignite a cigarette.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I have had the misfortune of meeting you
before,” Van Zandt replies, folding his arms and regarding
the other with blazing eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish captain shrugs his shoulders. “May I
ask where?” he inquires coolly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the United States.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The senor is mistaken. I have never been in the
states.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You lie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curse you! What d’ye mean?” demands the Spanish
captain in the purest of English, as he drops his hand
upon his sword hilt. The man at the table near by lays
down his paper and turns a pair of interested eyes toward
the young men.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You lie!” repeats Van Zandt, moving not a step. Then
he says in a voice passionate with hatred and ringing
with the exultation of a Nemesis about to strike:</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, Ralph Felton, I have found you at last!”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A WOMAN’S VENGEANCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The cigarette falls from the Spanish captain’s nerveless
fingers and his face turns gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” he gasps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name is Phillip Van Zandt. I don’t wonder,
Ralph Felton, that you fail to recognize me by that name,
though it is my true one. But you will understand why
I have sought you and why I exult in now standing face
to face with you, when I breathe the name of Ernest
Stanley!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are Ernest Stanley?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was Ernest Stanley. Now, I am his avenger.
Listen to me,” commands Van Zandt, as Felton strives
to speak. “When the doors of that New England prison
closed upon me, nearly three years ago, I swore that
I would be avenged upon the scoundrel who put me
there. Until a month ago I did not know his name.
Until to-day I was not sure that the father was an accomplice
to the villainy of the son. But when I did
learn who the coward was for whom I suffered I told
myself that this world, vast as it is, was too small to hold
him and me. Do you understand? You cur! Do you
understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Felton glances about the cafe. The soldier at the table
near by has again picked up his newspaper and is absorbed
in its columns. But any one who might take the
pains to investigate would discover that he is not reading
the paper. The score or more of others are occupied in
their drink, jest and song.</p>

<p class='c011'>Felton has regained his composure and lights a cigarette
with a steady hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you aware, Senor Van Zandt, that at one word
from me my men would cut you to pieces?” he sneers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that one such word will mean your instant
death,” is the stern response.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I shall not utter it,” says Felton, coolly. “I am
competent to take care of myself. A moment ago you
called me a coward. I will prove to you that I am not.
You seek satisfaction?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A bitter smile flits over Van Zandt’s face. “Satisfaction!”
he murmurs. “Ay, I demand satisfaction for two
years of utter misery and, by heavens, I shall have it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall! I swear it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! And when?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At once. This is my only opportunity to accommodate
you at present, as I am ordered to Cienfuegos to-morrow.
Come, I will wait for you without.” So saying,
Felton turns on his heel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt regards him with a look in which suspicion
is mingled with a trace of admiration for his sang froid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will attempt no treachery?” he says, sternly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you, sir, I am not a coward,” answers Felton,
haughtily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That he is not,” mutters the soldier with the scarred
forehead, and he adds, as if addressing the newspaper
in his hand: “This is a devilish unfortunate affair. I
must have a hand in it. Hello! Was not that a woman’s
scream?” He rises and, throwing open the door leading
to the rear of the cafe, steps out upon the veranda. An
instant later he dashes the door shut with an ejaculation
of amazement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Standing at the further end of the veranda, terror depicted
in her colorless cheeks, is Louise Hathaway. A
dozen feet from her is one of the troopers, who has
strolled out upon the veranda, and, while much the worse
for liquor, has plainly insulted the American girl. When
the new-comer arrives on the scene, he sees the caballero
wiping the blood from a long, deep scratch across his
rage-contorted face. Between insulter and insulted Cyrus
Felton interposes a feeble barrier.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a muttered malediction the baffled Spaniard turns
and re-enters the cafe, followed by the scarred soldier,
whose timely arrival has doubtless saved Miss Hathaway
from further affront.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jove! I shall have my hands full for a few minutes,”
that individual soliloquizes. “Ah, one moment,” as Van
Zandt attempts to brush by him. “You have some
friends out here, senor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” demands Van Zandt, with a stare.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get them away at once, or these devils in here may
make it hot for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have no time to listen to a lengthy explanation.
Do as I direct. Send your friends to the consul’s and
have them avoid the main road. There is a path through
the garden, and beyond that a trail down the hillside to
the beach. It is but a mile to the consul’s residence by
that route. They’ll be safe at the consul’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All this is delivered in low, rapid tones and as Van
Zandt moves away the soldier turns and sees the drunken
cavalier standing within a few feet of him, a malicious
smile upon his evil face. “Hello! What the devil are
you playing the spy for?” cries he of the scar, and passes
on with the muttered thought: “I wonder if the chap
understands English.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When Van Zandt rejoins Mr. Felton and Louise he
finds the old man as white as death and his head sunk
upon his breast, while Miss Hathaway is in a semi-hysterical
condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m so glad you have returned,” says the latter, as
she comes forward to greet him and she tells him of
the encounter with the Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The scoundrel!” grits Van Zandt, starting toward the
cafe. But he remembers that he has more serious business
on hand than thrashing a drunken trooper, and he
turns gravely to his companions:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hathaway, and you, Mr. Felton, I must ask you
to proceed immediately to the residence of the American
consul. I have a little matter that demands my presence
here for another half-hour, and meanwhile it will not be
safe for you to remain. Nor will it be well to go by the
main road. The city is in the hands of a mob. The
scoundrel who insulted you is a fair example. I was
warned by one of the men within—an Englishman, I
should judge from his voice and manner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Felton and Miss Hathaway regard Van Zandt apprehensively,
and Louise wonders at the pallor of his
face and the strange look in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know where the residence of the consul is. You
must follow yonder path through the garden, and strike
the trail down the hillside to the sea; it is only a short
walk. I will rejoin you there within the hour—if I
live,” says Van Zandt, with a significance not understood
by his auditors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without a word Cyrus Felton rises and, followed by
Miss Hathaway, starts off through the garden in the direction
indicated by Van Zandt’s outstretched arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>While all this has taken place Ralph Felton has been
leaning in the doorway at the front of the cafe. He looks
up when Sanchez, the besotted subaltern, comes in from
his encounter with the American girl, and signals to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sanchez, I have a little affair of honor to settle within
the hour,” he says. “If I do not return, you are second
in command. You understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it ‘a la mort’?” inquires Sanchez.</p>

<p class='c011'>Felton nods and turns away, and Sanchez goes back
into the cafe in season to hear the last words of the
warning extended to Van Zandt by the soldier with the
scar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Felton lights another cigarette and awaits indifferently
the appearance of his implacable foe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am ready, sir,” says a stern voice at his elbow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I have been ready for some minutes. Come.”
And Felton leads the way across the road and into a path
to the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>The soldier with the scar walks out into the dooryard
and watches the disappearing figures. “That duel must
not take place,” he says. “But how on earth am I to
prevent it? Hello! What’s this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His attention is attracted by an ejaculation within the
cafe. Two men are whispering by the window next the
entrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What deviltry is this?” he scowls, bending his head.
And as he listens the scowl deepens on his face, and his
fingers clutch at his pistol stock. “By heavens! I must
prevent that duel now,” he mutters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simultaneous with a command given to the half-intoxicated
Sanchez, he of the scar hears the sound of a
shot over in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Treachery!” he exclaims, and bounds away in the direction
of the report.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Felton and Van Zandt proceed silently into the thicket.
A short distance from the entrance to the woods is a
cleared spot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This will probably suit our purpose,” remarks Felton,
and, coolly, he measures off ten paces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be distance enough, will it not?” he asks.
Van Zandt nods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you give the word, Mr. Van Zandt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As you please. We will fire at the word ‘Three.’”
Both men draw their revolvers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One moment,” interrupts Felton. “In the event of
a second fire?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There will be no second fire,” is the grim rejoinder.
“I shall kill you with the first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I will endeavor not to waste mine. Well, sir, I
am waiting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One!” Two arms are raised, and not a tremor in
either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Two!” The pistols click.</p>

<p class='c011'>The word “Three” is trembling on Van Zandt’s lips,
when a shot rings out from the thicket. Felton clasps
his hand to his abdomen, with an exclamation of pain,
sways a moment and pitches headlong to the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bushes part and a woman, heavily veiled, steps
forth, smoking pistol in hand and walks to where Felton
lies.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looks upon the body for a moment in silence, and
hisses:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You cowardly hound! Your end is fitting!” Then,
throwing back her veil, she reveals the face of Isabel
Harding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have saved you, Phillip,” she says, with a calmness
that is very near madness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have cheated me of my vengeance,” he replies,
looking gloomily upon the body of her victim.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My wrongs called for greater vengeance than yours,”
cries the woman, her eyes glittering feverishly and her
voice breaking hysterically. “I followed him here. I
saw through the cafe window your meeting with him,
and I exulted that I was in time—in time to save the
man I loved! Phillip! Phillip,” sobs Isabel, sinking on
one knee beside him, “I told you that some day you
would realize how much I loved you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Van Zandt, with a shudder and expression of utter
aversion, turns away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I see I am too late,” remarks a quiet voice, and
Van Zandt looks up to see the friendly soldier with the
scar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the consul’s if you would save the American girl,”
says the latter. “I’ll look after these obsequies. Come,
be off,” as Van Zandt stares at him in surprise. “A plot
is afoot, headed by that precious Lieut. Sanchez, and you
have no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the consul—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The consul was at his office in the city two hours
ago, and is doubtless there yet. Ah, you are too late.”
The clatter of departing hoof-beats is borne upon their
ears. “No; you can reach the consul’s ahead of them,
by the short-cut down the hillside. Here! Take my revolver!
You may need more than one. And mind, don’t
waste any ammunition,” shouts the soldier, as Van Zandt
dashes off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he turns to the scene of the tragedy. He kneels
beside Felton’s body and makes a brief examination.
Then he straightens up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go!” he says sternly, to Mrs. Harding. “Your work
is done!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stares at him a moment, with her glittering eyes;
then, with a little shudder, tosses the revolver into the
bushes, turns and walks slowly away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The caballero watches her out of sight and again turns
to the body of the Spanish captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” he grunts, as he lifts the limp form from
the ground. “He is worth a dozen dead men, or my
name isn’t John Barker.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>AT BAY IN THE CONSUL’S HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“There is something very odd in Mr. Van Zandt’s actions,”
remarks Miss Hathaway, as she and Mr. Felton
follow the winding trail down the hillside to the sea.
The latter offers no explanation. He has aged fearfully
in the last half-hour, and it is now a bowed, feeble, old
man whom his companion more than once has to assist
over the obstacles in their rough path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the consul’s. To the consul’s,” is all he says, and
the journey is finished in silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The residence of William Atwood, United States consul,
is situated about two hundred yards back from the
shore, about a half a mile below the mole at Santiago.
The nearest neighbor is a quarter of a mile away, toward
the city. It is a plain, square, two-storied structure. A
broad veranda fronts both stories and ivy very nearly
conceals three of the walls of the building. An innovation,
to the Cuban view absurd, is an electric door bell,
put in by the consul himself. It is this bell that Mr.
Felton presses, with the remark: “I begin to feel at
home already.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The summons are answered by a porter who tells
them that the consul is gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone? Gone where?” demands Mr. Felton, with a
start of uneasiness that is inexplicable to Miss Hathaway.</p>

<p class='c011'>The consul is at the city. Where, quien sabe? Probably
at his office in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can do nothing except await his return or the
arrival of Mr. Van Zandt,” Louise says, as they step
into the hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the right of the entrance is the library. On the
desk is pen and paper, and here Cyrus Felton seats himself
and writes, while Louise stands in the doorway and
watches him with troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly she hears the sound of footsteps hurrying up
the walk. The door is thrown open, and Van Zandt,
breathing hard from the exertion of his run, stands before
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank God, you are safe!” he cries, fervently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What danger threatens?” asks Louise, laying one
hand upon Van Zandt’s arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>For answer he leads the way out upon the veranda.
“Look!” he says; and Miss Hathaway beholds the Semiramis,
resting quietly upon the still bosom of the bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must reach that yacht, or I fear we may not
leave Cuba alive!” he tells her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Louise gazes at him in questioning dismay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, there comes the enemy,” says Van Zandt, pointing
up the beach toward the city. A small troop of
horsemen is approaching at a lively canter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is all this mystery? Why do you fear those
men?” asks Louise, as they re-enter the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not for myself that I tremble,” replies Van
Zandt, who is critically examining his pistols.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it is I whom they seek. Your silence answers
yes,” says Louise quietly. She is very white, but her
voice does not tremble. Like a true heroine she has
grown calm in the face of danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By heaven!” Van Zandt bursts forth; “my life stands
between you and those Spanish devils, and gladly do I
place it there. As for you,” turning to Cyrus Felton,
who has risen from the library table and stands near
them, “I would not lift a finger to save your worthless
existence. For the wrongs which I have suffered, for
the misery which you and your son have caused me,
I meant to have exacted a bitter reparation, but fate
has otherwise decreed. Ah, you know me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spare me your reproaches,” says the old man, lifting
his hand in protest. “I know you. You are Ernest Stanley.
What I have dreaded, yet for nearly a year expected,
has come at last. My sin has found me out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, that it has. But you are safe from my hands now,
and maybe from that of the law before this day is ended.
Out of the way, unless you wish your miserable life cut
short by a Spanish bullet. Miss Hathaway, I must ask
you to step into the library, as our visitors have arrived.”
And, throwing open the door, Van Zandt stands upon
the threshold, waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Sanchez and his men rein their horses within
a dozen paces of the house. The leader dismounts
and comes leisurely up the walk, apparently oblivious
of the presence of Van Zandt, whose watchful eyes are
covering every movement of the scoundrelly band.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One moment,” commands the American, holding up
his hand. But the Spaniard pays not the slightest attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halt!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This time Sanchez pauses and strokes his mustachios
with exasperating calmness. “I would advise the senor
to make no opposition if he values his life,” he says.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is your errand here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The American senorita, to whom I am indebted for
this token.” Sanchez indicates the long, dull-red scratch
upon his unamiable visage. “I have no time or inclination
to parley with you, senor. Out of the way, or I shall
order my men to fire upon you.” The troopers half-raise
their carbines.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt tears down a worn edition of the stars and
stripes that decks the wall above his head, and as he
throws it across his breast and shoulder his voice rings
out defiantly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fire upon the American flag, if you dare!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The answer is a volley that splinters the woodwork
about him and brings down the glass above the door in
a shower. Van Zandt feels a sharp twinge in his left
arm, and with an exclamation of rage and pain he lifts
his revolver and fires.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lieutenant Sanchez falls dead in his tracks and there
is an instant scattering out of range on the part of his
followers.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Van Zandt closes the door and slips the bolt he
turns to see Cyrus Felton lying upon the floor, a stream
of blood flowing from a wound in his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fool! I cautioned him to keep out of range,” he exclaims,
as he bends over the old man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he badly hurt?” asks the voice of Louise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear so. We must retreat upstairs, as we may expect
an assault at any instant. Quick!”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Louise ascends to the floor above, Van Zandt follows
with his unconscious burden. In the rear room
is a sofa, and upon this Mr. Felton is laid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have but a few minutes to live. Forgive me,” he
gasps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God may forgive you,” replies Van Zandt, turning
bitterly away. Louise takes his hand in hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely, Mr. Van Zandt, you can forgive the past in
this awful moment,” she says, softly. “Remember, he
was a father and he loved his son.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the contact of that little hand Van Zandt feels a
thrill creep over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know now who I am,” he says, dully. The blue
eyes meet the dark ones unwaveringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that I believe in your innocence and that I
trust you,” is the quiet response. “Listen, he is speaking
again.” They bend their heads to catch the sinking
man’s last words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In my—coat—papers,” gasps Mr. Felton, with his
fast-glazing eyes fixed on Van Zandt. “They—will—clear—your—name,”
he finishes and sinks back, exhausted
by his effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cyrus Felton,” says Van Zandt, gravely, “if any forgiveness
of mine will afford you an iota of comfort on
your journey to the other world, it is yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The dying man acknowledges the absolution with a
glance. An instant later his spirit passes to his Maker,
to be judged by his deeds in this world of sorrow and sin,
of hope and happiness.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Again the Cafe de Almendras. The boisterous troopers
are gone and in their place a dozen or so quiet-appearing
men in civilian dress are grouped about the
tables, drinking little and talking less.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been a noisy day, the patron tells a tall man
with black eyes and fierce mustachios, who lounges in
the doorway and sweeps the street with his keen gaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the tall man heeds not the chatter of the patron;
his gaze is fixed curiously upon an approaching soldier,
who bears across his shoulder the limp form of a man
in the uniform of a Spanish captain. The face of the
latter is hidden.</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker brushes by into the cafe with the body of
Ralph Felton, and meets the contemptuous glance of the
tall man with a searching look that the latter does not
fancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, there, patron! A room and a doctor at once!”
orders the detective, and he gives the patron a handful of
coin and effectually silences his grumbling protest about
making a hospital of the place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having deposited his burden above stairs, Barker returns
to the drinking-room and astonishes the tall man
with the black eyes by tapping him on the shoulder and
remarking:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I have met you before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mischief you have!” is the curt rejoinder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I am sure of it,” grins Barker. “Your voice
has not changed, but your mustachios do not fit you.
Pardon me,” he adds, just in season to prevent an outbreak,
“I am indebted to you for this slash,” indicating
the scar across his forehead, “but I do not lay up any
hard feelings. I’ll call it quits if you will lend some
friends of mine a helping hand. I have got my hands
full upstairs. Listen.” Barker briefly recounts the episodes
narrated in the previous chapter.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the tall man listens his brow grows black as night,
and when the tale is finished his voice rings through
the cafe in a sharp command:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haste, my comrades! To the American consul’s to
save my friends!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The quiet-appearing civilians about the tables leap to
their feet as one man, and, leaving the unpaid patron
standing in hopeless astonishment amid the ruins of
the glassware he has dropped, the little band sweeps out
of the cafe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There will be music at the consul’s this afternoon, unless
I am greatly mistaken,” mutters Barker, as he looks
down the dust-veiled road. “And now for my patient.
If he dies with his secret unrevealed I’ll never forgive
him!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LV.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>A SIGNAL FROM MACEDONIA.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Van Zandt and Louise stand, hand in hand, gazing
sorrowfully upon all that is mortal of Cyrus Felton. A
crash is heard below, as the front door is burst from its
hinges.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt leaps to the head of the staircase just as the
feet of a brace of ruffians are on the lower step. Twice
cracks his revolver and his aim is true. One of the
Spaniards falls and the second drops back with a cry of
pain. Then, as Van Zandt throws himself to one side,
there is a flash of fire below, and the bullets whistle harmlessly
by.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he judges, there is no immediate second rush by the
attacking party, so he proceeds to examine his surroundings
and the result is far from satisfactory. There is no
serious danger of the besiegers attempting to carry the
staircase by storm. The Spaniard is not lacking in courage,
but it requires a considerable amount of sand to
lead the way to certain death. But the room to which
they have retreated was not built for a fortress and he
realizes that the end must come when the enemy will
gain access to the second floor—by the veranda or by the
rear entrance to the building.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly his eyes rest upon a ladder at the other end
of the short hallway.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick!” he whispers to Louise, as he points the way
to temporary safety.</p>

<p class='c011'>A minute later and they are on the roof of the building,
the ladder pulled up, and the scuttle fastened down.
Over them floats, from the flagstaff, the glorious banner
of their native land, and above that bends a sky of heaven’s
deepest blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fairly outwitted!” says Van Zandt. Suddenly he feels
a weakness come over him and he sinks upon the sun-baked
roof. Then for the first time Louise notices that
he is wounded, and she kneels beside him with a very
white face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is nothing,” he reassures her. With her assistance
he removes his coat, tears open the left sleeve of his shirt
and discloses a bullet hole in the fleshy part of the arm.
It looks more serious than it really is and Louise feels an
inclination to faint. But she resists it and proceeds to
bind up the still bleeding wound with strips torn from her
own silken petticoat. The golden head is very close to
the brown one, and as the fair surgeon bends to tie a
knot, the soft sweep of her hair steals away all of Van
Zandt’s well-guarded reserve, and his right arm encircles
her in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I love you! I love you!” he whispers.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Miss Hathaway, being a sensible young woman,
who knows what she wants, does not remark upon the
“suddenness” of the declaration of love, but presses her
red lips to his and tells Phillip that she has loved him
ever since she knew him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the lovers are brought back to earth by a chorus
of yells and picturesque profanity sufficient to supply the
captain of a whaling bark for an entire voyage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have discovered our retreat,” whispers Van
Zandt, as he lifts the scuttle and listens to the tumult below.
But he drops it as a bullet crashes through a few
inches from his head, and moves out of such dangerous
range. Then, as his eyes rest upon the flag above him an
idea seizes him—a veritable inspiration. He steps to the
flag-staff, detaches the halyards and the stars and stripes
come fluttering down to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing with the flag?” asks Louise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Giving utterance to the old Macedonian cry,” he calls
back, and up goes old glory again, this time with the
union jack down. “Pray that my crew may see the
signal,” he adds, fervently. And Providence assists his
effort, for a puff of wind streams the flag straight out
upon the breeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals is on the bridge of the Semiramis at this
moment, looking toward the shore, and his curiosity is
excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>He sweeps the roof top with one glance through his
powerful glance and then issues a command that echoes
to the farthest corners of the Semiramis.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few moments later Van Zandt sees two boats cut
shoreward through the blue waters of the bay as fast as
muscle can send them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank heaven!” he exclaims, as his heart bounds
within him, and he proceeds to hug Louise in a manner
that vastly entertains Capt. Beals, who is still an interested
though distant spectator. And if the bluff old sea
dog could have made himself heard he would have shouted
a warning, for he discerns what Van Zandt cannot
see—a ladder placed against the side wall of the consul’s
house and three men ascending it, while back a short distance,
with carbines raised, stand the rest of the scoundrelly
horde.</p>

<p class='c011'>The attack bids fair to be successful, but suddenly rings
out the cry of “Santiago!” and the little band of patriots
from the Cafe de Almendras dashes upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spaniards now have all the fighting they can
attend to. Van Zandt and Louise watch from the rooftop
the progress of the battle royal. The fight is won.
No quarter is given, and those of the Spaniards who have
the ability to flee are in full retreat, and as they disappear
down the beach they shout:</p>

<p class='c011'>“El Terredo! El Terredo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt sees a strange transformation in the appearance
of the leader of the rescuing party. During a
hand-to-hand struggle with one of the troopers his fierce
mustachios have been knocked off, and it is a handsome,
beardless youth, with flashing black eyes, who looks
about him and remarks: “Well, my merry men, the victory
is ours, but where are the Americans?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Coming,” sings out Van Zandt, from the upper air.
“We will be with you in a minute.” And as he turns to
Louise that young lady proceeds to faint in his arms.
It is a logical reaction from the strain which she has
borne with wonderful fortitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>By this time the boats from the Semiramis have arrived,
and in them enough fighting Yankees to handle
twice their number of Spanish soldiery. A ladder
is placed against the consul’s house and the besieged
are assisted to earth, one unconscious and the other with
an arm tied up.</p>

<p class='c011'>While revivifying operations are under way Van Zandt
hears a startled exclamation at his elbow. It comes from
El Terredo, who is gazing upon the marble countenance
of Miss Hathaway with astonished and troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without replying to Van Zandt’s questioning look, El
Terredo picks up his mustachios from the sand and again
affixes them to his face. Then he turns calmly to Van
Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The third of your party? I was told there was an old
gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is dead. Killed at the first fire,” Van Zandt tells
him, and he leads the way into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the two men look upon the body, which has not
been disturbed by the troopers, El Terredo shudders,
and murmurs: “My God, what does all this mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It means much to me,” replies Van Zandt, gravely,
as he takes from the dead man’s person a packet of
papers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without speaking El Terredo steps to the sofa and assists
Van Zandt to bear the remains from the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>The body is laid in the bow of one of the boats, reverently
covered, and preparations are made for the return
to the Semiramis. When all but himself and the rescuing
party from the cafe have embarked Van Zandt turns
to El Terredo, who, with folded arms, is gazing abstractedly
toward the law-and-order deserted city. “You are
going with us, are you not?” he asks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I shall remain here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your safety lies with yonder yacht.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Safety? Ah, senor, somewhere on this isle is one
dearer to me than personal security.” And the young
man turns away to hide his emotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you can gain nothing by remaining here now.
The survivors of the late scrimmage have recognized
you and in half an hour the whole town will be at your
heels. Aboard my yacht you will be safe and I will gladly
land you at any point on the island you may designate.
Besides, the papers—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say no more, senor,” exclaims El Terredo, extending
his hand. “I accept your generous offer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dismissing his faithful followers, with the assurance
that he will be with them again ere many days, the revolutionary
leader steps into one of the waiting boats.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they are about to push off a soldier whose horse
is flecked with foam comes dashing down the beach, and
as he leaps from his well-nigh broken steed, he calls out
cheerily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Got room for one more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! My friend of the cafe,” cries Van Zandt. “You
are very welcome, senor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And just in time,” remarks John Barker, detective, as
with a hearty thwack he sends his horse riderless down
the beach and clambers into the boat.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVI.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE FATE OF THE SEMIRAMIS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“And now, what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boats have reached the Semiramis. Louise Hathaway
has been tenderly assisted to the deck by Van
Zandt, followed by Navarro and Barker, and the dead
form of Cyrus Felton has been reverently conveyed
aboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sort of council of war is being held on the quarter-deck
of the yacht, participated in by Van Zandt, Navarro
and Capt. Beals. The master of the Semiramis looks
inquiringly at the insurgent leader as he utters the words
quoted above.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For me personally there is but one course,” replies
Navarro. “I must land somewhere in the night and make
my way to Gen. Masso’s camp. That will not be a difficult
matter. It is your own situation that I am considering.
The American man-of-war, is she still in the harbor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals shakes his head. “She sailed an hour ago
for Key West, for supplies and instructions. She will
not return for at least two days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro’s face grows grave. “Then you are not safe
from molestation even in this vessel and under that flag,”
he says, pointing to the red, white and blue floating from
the masthead. “Without a man-of-war to protect you,
the Spaniards, knowing that El Terredo is aboard, will
search your yacht, possibly confiscate her and subject you
to no end of annoyance, even though they should not
find El Terredo. They respect no flag, no emblem, no
rules of civilized nations, unless they are absolutely compelled
to by superior force. You saw how they treated
the American flag above the consul’s own residence.
There are now three Spanish gunboats in the harbor.
Within the hour I fear your yacht will be surrounded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there is but one thing to do,” promptly replies
Van Zandt. “Capt. Beals, have steam got up at once
and weigh anchor. We will follow the America to Key
West.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is silence on the quarter-deck for a few moments.
Miss Hathaway has retired to her former stateroom
immediately upon setting foot upon the yacht, and
Barker is intently watching the shore from the bridge.
For the time being Van Zandt and Navarro are alone.
Suddenly the former breaks the silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not a Cuban,” he says. “Why are you enlisted
with the nondescript army of the insurrectionists?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro flushes at the word nondescript, but does not
reply at once. Finally he says quietly: “No, I am not
a Cuban. I am, like yourself, an American. But my
ancestors were Cuban, back more than six generations.
Until ten months ago,” continues Navarro, in a less-impassioned
tone, “I was a careless, happy-go-lucky American
youth, without any specific aim in life. But when the
Cuban insurrection broke out, I was consumed with an
overmastering desire to help free Cuba from the accursed
yoke of Spain. I have sacrificed everything to that end,
and now I am known to the Spaniards as ‘El Terredo,’
the terror. I believe I have been of some service to the
struggling natives, and so I shall continue until Cuba is
free, or–”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro does not complete the sentence. While he
was speaking the smoke has been pouring out of the
chimneys of the yacht in steadily increasing volume, and
now the clank of the steam windlass announces that the
vessel is getting under way. Without replying to Navarro’s
words, Van Zandt hastens below to inform Miss
Hathaway of the destination of the yacht. Capt. Beals
has taken his station on the bridge and the graceful vessel
steams slowly toward the narrow entrance to the harbor
of Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro watches intently the three Spanish warships
by which the Semiramis must pass within half a mile.
As the yacht draws nearer, the watcher notes with anxiety
a boat hastily putting out from the government
wharf and evidently making for the flagship of the fleet,
the Infanta Isabel. He communicates his discovery to
Van Zandt, who has returned from below, with the comment:
“They are evidently notifying the cruiser to have
her stop this vessel. Rather than that she fire on the
yacht and endanger the lives of those on board, including
the young lady, you must surrender me. Then they may
permit you to go unmolested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No man leaves this ship for a Spanish prison or the
garrote,” replies Van Zandt, his eyes burning with excitement,
“as long as there is a timber of her afloat. It
is less than six miles to the entrance to the harbor, and
once outside we can snap our fingers at a whole fleet of
Spanish cruisers. Besides, with all the various craft scattered
about the harbor, they will not dare to fire on us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro shakes his head skeptically, but does not reply.
The boat has reached the side of the war vessel.
The Semiramis is now nearly abreast of the latter and
distant less than half a mile. Suddenly a puff of smoke
rises from the forward deck of the Spaniard, followed by
the sharp crack of a rifle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There! She has signaled you to heave to,” remarks
Navarro. “As I told you, you must surrender me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is my answer,” replies the owner of the Semiramis,
drawing his revolver and firing two shots in the air.
Then to Capt. Beals on the bridge he sings out: “Full
speed ahead!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Smoke is now pouring from the stacks of the warship,
and it is evident that she is preparing to pursue the
American yacht, but she does not, as Navarro predicted,
fire on the latter. Before the cruiser gets well under way
the Semiramis is within four miles of the channel that
marks the entrance to the harbor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt smiles at Navarro. “We will lead him a
merry race if he thinks to catch the Semiramis,” he remarks.
“This yacht can go two miles to his one. And
if he hasn’t improved in his marksmanship I will risk his
guns. Ah, there goes the first one!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spaniard has succeeded in getting within range
of the yacht without endangering any of the other craft,
and the roar of his forward gun is heard as Van Zandt
speaks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An eighth of a mile to windward,” observes the latter,
as he watches the solid shot skip over the water. “He
can’t race and shoot, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Evidently the pursuer has come to the same conclusion,
for he fires no more guns, but doggedly plows the placid
waters of the harbor after the great black yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now the latter is less than half a mile from the
cleft in the precipitous coast line. Capt. Beals has slowed
down the engines and the yacht is picking her way by
the reefs that guard the channel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ship ahoy!” suddenly rings out from the lookout forward.
All eyes are turned ahead. A steamer, inward
bound, has just come into view in the channel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Permit me,” Navarro takes the glasses and focuses
them upon the stranger. “It is the Spanish dispatch boat
Pizarro,” he says. “When the cruiser recognizes her she
will doubtless signal her to intercept the yacht, and in
the narrow channel she can make serious trouble, I
fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The report of another cannon, followed by two more
in quick succession, shows that the man-of-war has indeed
recognized her compatriot almost as soon as the
American. An answering gun from the dispatch boat
also shows that she has heard and understands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals looks inquiringly at Van Zandt. “We must
continue straight on and take our chances in the channel
with that craft,” the latter says. Then to Navarro: “Do
you know what her armament is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, she is not a fighting ship. She has no armament,
merely one gun for saluting purposes, and her
crew cannot number over fifty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we are all right. If she gets in our way she
must take the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the dispatch boat evidently does not intend that
the American shall pass. She has taken a position in the
narrowest part of the channel and lies stationary, presenting
her broadside to the oncoming yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Signal that we propose to pass to port,” Van Zandt
says to Capt. Beals, “and if the Spaniard gets in our
course run him down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals nods and a second later the hoarse whistle
of the Semiramis echoes over the waters. The signal is
answered with a rifle shot from the Spaniard’s forward
deck and the dispatch boat moves forward two lengths,
so that she lies fair and square in the announced course
of the yacht.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there are no signs of slackening on the part of the
latter, and her black hull looks threatening indeed to the
officers of the dispatch boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>Caramba! Surely she will not run down the royal
vessel! Yet it looks very like it! But they will not
dare! Still—the Spanish commander hesitates no longer.
He signals his vessel to back at full speed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Too late!</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pizarro has moved less than half a length when
the American yacht crashes into her. There is a grinding
shock that brings Louise Hathaway in terror to the
deck of the Semiramis, and then the yacht continues on
her course, apparently unharmed. Van Zandt catches a
glimpse of a great jagged hole in the bow of the Spaniard,
into which the water is pouring in a cataract; of
a panic-stricken crew rushing frantically for the boats;
and then he turns to Miss Hathaway. It is nothing, he
assures her tenderly; a slight collision, but the yacht is
all right and perhaps she had better return to her stateroom
for the present. Later on—and Louise smiles, a
little sadly, but permits Van Zandt to conduct her to the
saloon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Beals is awaiting Van Zandt as the latter bounds
up the steps a minute later. “We are badly stove forward,”
he reports, “and are making water quite rapidly.
With the steam pumps going, we may keep afloat three
or four hours, but the yacht is doomed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt is so startled at the news that for a moment
he is speechless. His eyes rove back to the Spanish warship,
and then at the nearly perpendicular cliffs by which
the Semiramis is steaming.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looks for the dispatch boat, but it is not in sight.
“The Spaniard?” he inquires, mechanically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone to the bottom,” laconically replies the captain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there is no hope for us but to keep on and try
to land by the boats somewhere on the coast,” Van Zandt
says. “The Spaniards will treat us all as enemies, now
that we have sunk one of their boats. How long can we
keep up this speed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps an hour, perhaps more. The water will put
out the fires.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, have the boats quietly prepared and keep within
reach of land. Do you think the Spaniards will continue
the pursuit?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Undoubtedly. They will stop only to pick up the
crew of the Pizarro, and then will keep on after us. If
there was some little bay near here where we could beach
the yacht, but there isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The noble craft continues to plow the waves and her
injured bow still tosses the foam on either side, but her
speed is sensibly diminishing. All on board have recognized
the fact that the yacht is doomed, but there is no
confusion, no manifest anxiety. The boats have been
prepared and each member of the crew has secured in
a little package his most valued possessions. On the
quarter-deck Van Zandt, Navarro, Barker and Louise
Hathaway are silently watching the Spanish warship.
The latter is gaining now, for the Semiramis is steadily
settling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Navarro, his hat drawn over his eyes and his coat
wrapped about him so that his countenance is partially
veiled, has carefully avoided Louise. When she returns
to the deck he walks over to where John Barker is leaning
against the rail and remarks in Spanish:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you do not desire to be shot as a deserter I should
advise you to borrow a suit of clothes from our friend,
the owner of the yacht.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective starts. “I guess you’re right,” he replies
in English, and turns to Van Zandt. Five minutes later
he emerges from the cabin attired in a fashionable suit
of gray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The water is within two inches of the boilers,” reports
the engineer, and Van Zandt sighs heavily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” he says, “we may as well take to the boats.
Come.” He leads Louise to the steamer’s launch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he?” Louise points to where the body of Cyrus
Felton lies, covered by its winding sheet of canvas.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will go down with the Semiramis. He could have
no nobler tomb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Boom! The roar of the Spanish gun is the salute the
people of the Semiramis hear as the boats pull away from
the doomed yacht. The cruiser is within range and
though her commander must be aware that the American
vessel is sinking he is firing on her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The coward!” grits Van Zandt. “But the Semiramis
will not strike her flag. She sinks with the stars and
stripes flying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pull hard!” shouts Capt. Beals. “Pull hard! She’s
going down!”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>AN INTERNATIONAL EPISODE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“Ashley, we will give you something to write about,”
remarks Capt. Meade, as the America steams out of the
harbor of Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s that, captain? A thrilling description of a
voyage from Santiago de Cuba to Key West?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The commander of the cruiser smiles good-naturedly.
“More excitement than that, and something that will
cause the little senorita to cling frantically to your arm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, then, you may open the ball at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet; not for an hour. In short, we are going to
burn some powder by and by. A little target practice,
and if you have never seen anything of the sort you will
be rather interested.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Confound his target practice,” Jack mutters disgustedly,
as Capt. Meade bustles away. “The only powder-burning
I want to see is the shelling of the dingy old city
of Santiago by the Spanish fleet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Ashley’s temporary annoyance is soon forgotten
in the pleasure of assisting Juanita up and down the steep
ladders, of explaining the machinery, the guns, the great
searchlight and the thousand and one interesting features
of the cruiser.</p>

<p class='c011'>The target practice, he also finds, is a decidedly interesting
affair, after all, which conclusion may have been
influenced by the manifest delight of his sweetheart over
the novel experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the last gun is fired, the buoy mark is demolished,
and, within forty-eight hours, Capt. Meade tells Jack,
the America will be lying at anchor in the harbor of Key
West.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she will return to Santiago, when?” the correspondent
inquires. “I must be back at the finish, if the
insurgents capture the city and it is shelled by the Spanish
fleet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Capt. Meade shakes his head. “That depends on instructions
received at Key West. I suppose though, that
the cruiser would be ordered directly back to Santiago
after coaling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the captain is summoned to the bridge, where
it is evident that some unusual occurrence is engrossing
the attention of the officers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jack observes that the captain has his glass turned toward
the northwest, and he also looks in that direction.
Trails of black smoke low down on the horizon, evidently
from two steamers, are all that reward his gaze, but he
notices that the course of the America has been changed
and that her speed has been materially accelerated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is in the wind?” he inquires, casually, of the
youthful ensign.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just what we’re going to find out,” is the reply,
and Ashley follows Capt. Meade to the bridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing special that we know of,” is that official’s
response to Jack’s query as to the cause of the change of
course. “Some stranger, probably a Spanish gunboat,
is in pursuit of another steamer, and as it is not much out
of our course I concluded to run up nearer the scene.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The white cruiser is now rushing along at a speed that
reminds Jack of his first memorable trip upon her, and
is rapidly reducing the cloud of smoke on the horizon to
the outlines of a formidable man-of-war.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Spanish cruiser Infanta Isabel,” is the conclusion
of Capt. Meade, after a long and careful study of the distant
steamer. “But the craft she is in pursuit of I cannot
quite make out. She is a large steamship of some sort
and the Don is overhauling her hand over fist. We shall
be there just in time to see the fun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The America’s course is converging toward that of
pursuer and pursued. Capt. Meade’s keen eyes are alternately
riveted on the Spanish warship and the unknown
vessel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that steamship did not set so low in the water,” he
remarks, thoughtfully, “and was going about two-thirds
faster, I should say that she was our old friend, the big
black yacht Semiramis. But—great heaven! The steamer
is sinking! That’s what’s the matter with her! She is
steadily settling!”</p>

<p class='c011'>All eyes on the cruiser are now directed toward the
crippled stranger. She is, as Capt. Meade says, slowly
sinking while yet the waters are dashing on either side of
her bow like mountain streams.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A game struggle, but all in vain,” is the comment of
the captain, shaking his head. “Probably the Spaniard
hulled him below the water line early in the struggle,
and he has been slowly making water ever since. He
can’t last much longer. The water must be near the fires
now. Ah! I thought so!”</p>

<p class='c011'>For the strange steamer has apparently lost headway.
The black smoke that a moment before poured from her
chimneys now mingles with a white cloud of steam.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her fires are out,” Capt. Meade explains to Ashley.
“She will go down in twenty minutes, if she doesn’t blow
up before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boom of a heavy cannon startles the watchers and
they turn quickly to the Spanish man-of-war. A curling
wreath of smoke from her forward deck tells the origin
of the report, and their eyes return to the sinking vessel.
A puff of wind lifts for a moment the flag hanging limp
at her masthead, as if in mute defiance of the Spanish
shot. Capt. Meade starts as if he had received an electric
shock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The American flag!” he thunders, “and fired on by
the Spaniard!” Then to the executive officer: “Signal
for the forced draught and bear down on the steamer.
We will pick up her boats and then investigate the outrage
on the flag.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another shot, and still another, comes echoing over
the water from the Infanta Isabel, her target the fast-filling
steamer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly Ashley is electrified by the command in the
stentorian tones of Capt. Meade:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Clear the ship for action!”</p>

<p class='c011'>A second later the trumpet’s harsh notes and the sharp
rattle of drum, mingling with the shrill whistles and
rough voices of the boatswain, mates and the noisy clanging
of the electric gongs, call the sturdy crew of the
America to “general quarters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, indeed, is the blood of the newspaper man
stirred by the scenes about him. The decks throb with
the rush of hurrying feet as the men hasten to their stations.
The gun crews are casting loose the great guns,
the murderous rapid-fire cannon and the secondary batteries.
Some are hastily donning equipments, others filling
sponge-buckets and still others stripping themselves
of all superfluous clothing, laying bare their brawny
forms.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hatches are covered, hose laid and pumps rigged, ladders
torn away, and decks turned topsy-turvy, in the
twinkling of an eye. Rifles, cutlasses and revolvers come
out from the armory in quantities that amaze Ashley.
The marine guard falls in and topmen are scrambling
nimbly aloft to secure anything movable there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down come the rails, out come davits and awning
stanchions—everything movable is stowed away or secured.
The magazines are opened and the tackle rigged
over the ammunition hatches ready to hoist shot and shell
for the guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The grim panoply of war,” Jack thinks, as he hastens
to conduct the wondering Juanita below. Even here, he
observes to his great surprise, the captain’s sacred cabin
has been invaded “on the jump” by the crews of the after
guns.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Ashley returns to the quarter-deck he notes that
the America is bearing hard down almost at right angles
on the Spanish warship, now distant less than a mile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Evidently here is an excellent opportunity for an international
episode,” he thinks, as he glances at the stern
face of “Fighting Dave” Meade on the bridge. Then
his hand involuntarily goes to his ears and he catches at
the rail for support, as the forward gun of the American
cruiser thunders forth and an eight-pound solid shot
skims over the waves across the bow of the Spanish
cruiser.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he recovers from the shock of the concussion
there is a murmured, “She’s going!” from the officers on
the quarter-deck and Jack looks quickly in the direction
of the sinking steamer. But the black hull has already
disappeared beneath the waves and he sees only the fluttering
red, white and blue ere the whirling eddies reach
their eager arms for the beautiful emblem.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gun from the America does not have the anticipated
effect on the Spaniard, for he continues full speed
toward the spot where the steamer sunk. But it has
evidently had effect in another direction. With the aid
of his marine glasses Ashley observes four boats, which
had hitherto escaped his notice, pulling toward the white
cruiser. The purpose of the Spanish vessel is thus apparent.
She designs to cut off the fleeing boats before
they may reach the America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the white cruiser careens to one side and a second
deafening report, this time the gun from amidship,
roars out in language not to be misunderstood by the
on-rushing Spanish man-of-war.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a rapid gush of escaping steam, the stacks
cease to vomit forth their black clouds and the Infanta
Isabel turns her course and steams slowly toward the
America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley watches curiously the flashing oars of the
coming boats, and when the forward one is almost within
hail he lifts the glasses to his eyes and scans her passengers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thunder and Mars!” he exclaims, “if there isn’t John
Barker in the bow and—yes, it must be Louise Hathaway,
Van Zandt, and—who the devil is that chap with
the ferocious mustachios? El Terredo, or I’m a sinner!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>THE END OF THE TRAIL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>When the first boat is alongside the America, Barker
is the first man to clamber to the deck, and the first individual
he gets his eye on is Jack Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello! Well met,” remarks that young man, extending
his hand. “I was expecting you any minute.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker gives Jack’s hand a perfunctory clasp and
passes on with a gruff “Hello!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not yet forgiven. I see,” thinks Ashley, as he
turns to the rest of the party coming aboard. He greets
Miss Hathaway warmly and Van Zandt genially, and
grips Navarro’s hand with a pressure of strong friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no present opportunity for mutual explanations,
as a serious interruption is apparent in the shape
of a boat that has put out from the Spanish man-of-war
and is rapidly approaching the America.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a shade of anxiety the people of the Semiramis
await the arrival of the boat. They note the preparations
to receive with due honor the representative of the Infanta
Isabel, the marines drawn up in double file beside
the gangway, the officers of the America in position on
the quarter-deck. But there is no time for speculation or
conjecture. Eight pairs of dripping oars are simultaneously
raised, the boat glides softly to the side of the
cruiser, and a moment later the Spanish officer is bowing
profoundly to the commander of the America.</p>

<p class='c011'>His excellency, Admiral Sanchez of his majesty’s man-of-war
Infanta Isabel, presents his compliments to the
commander of the United States cruiser America and
begs to say that the passengers, officers and crew of the
steamer just sunk, who have sought asylum on the
American vessel, are rebels, in arms against his majesty
the king of Spain; that their vessel, just sunk, has within
the last three hours destroyed the royal Spanish dispatch
boat Pizarro. Wherefore his excellency respectfully asks
that the said officers, passengers and crew of the rebel
ship be delivered to the representative of her majesty’s
ship Infanta Isabel as prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Meade listens patiently while the Spanish officer
delivers his message, his brow knitting slightly at
the reference to the destruction of the dispatch boat.
Then he turns to Captain Beals:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What have you to say to this statement and why were
you flying the American flag, if you were in command
of an insurgent vessel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are not insurgents and we did not destroy the
dispatch boat,” is the reply. “The pleasure yacht Semiramis
of New York, Van Zandt owner, was in collision
with the Pizarro in the harbor of Santiago. The Pizarro
stood directly in our course, notwithstanding our signals
that we proposed to pass to port. We should have gone
aground if we had not fouled her. We did not stop, as
the Semiramis was badly stove and subsequently sunk,
as you have seen. Further, our officers and crew and the
passengers are without exception American citizens. As
such, I appeal to the commander of an American vessel
for protection.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you shall have it,” murmurs Captain Meade
under his breath. To the Spaniard he says: “Present
my compliments to his excellency, Admiral Sanchez, and
say that the commander of the America finds upon investigation
that the officers and crew of the late steamer
Semiramis are American citizens, who claim the protection
of the American flag; that her captain and officers
maintain that the destruction of the Pizarro was an
accident for which they are in no wise responsible.
Therefore I am constrained to decline to grant the courteous
request of his excellency.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Spanish officer bows respectfully and continues:
“His excellency also desired to convey to the commander
of the United States cruiser America the information
that among the persons lately on board the sunken
steamer was one Cuban rebel, denominated El Terredo,
whom his excellency has every reason to believe has
sought refuge on board this ship. He respectfully requests
that said El Terredo be delivered to the representative
of his majesty’s ship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Meade’s eye strays over the little group, but
before he can speak Navarro steps forward and says in
English: “I have been designated as El Terredo, but I
am an American citizen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can testify to that statement,” supplements Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Meade waves his hand. “That is sufficient.
Inform his excellency that all of the persons picked up
in the boats from the lost steamer are American citizens.
As such, I cannot surrender them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the officer bows, and his errand performed, he
salutes and returns to the boat. What will be the effect
of his report? Will Admiral Sanchez resent with force
Captain Meade’s decision, or will he gracefully bow to
the inevitable? The latter apparently, for a few moments
after the officer ascends the side of the man-of-war the
Spanish flag is dipped in salute to the America and the
Infanta Isabel steams slowly back in the direction of
Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Again is Providence on the side of the heaviest guns,”
murmurs Ashley, as he walks over to where Barker is
leaning against the rail, and claps him on the back.
“John, I am powerful glad to see you,” he declares
heartily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know whether I can say the same or not,”
rejoins the detective, sulkily. “For a man whose infernal
meddling with affairs that did not concern him nearly
cost me my life, you appear pretty cool and unconcerned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear friend,” says Ashley, “if I had not been at
Jibana half a dozen days ago you would never have
forgiven yourself for the part you played as a soldier of
Castile. Do you know who Don Carlos was?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know he, or she, was a woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; and if you had shown yourself after the scrimmage,
instead of sneaking off to Santiago, I might have
told you of my discovery.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ungrateful wretch!” cries Ashley in mock reproach.
“I admit that I got you into the scrape, but I also got
you out of it. The fiery El Terredo would have strung
you to a telegraph pole had I not begged for your life
and liberty. Yes; Don Carlos was a woman, and she
was Helen Hathaway.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then El Terredo?” marvels the detective, who is beginning
to see daylight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was Derrick Ames, of course. Anyone except a detective
would have discovered that long ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed,” retorts Barker. “When did you find it out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Early this morning,” laughs Ashley. “But let us be
serious. Where are the Feltons, father and son?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One dead, and the other perhaps so,” replies Barker,
and he tells Ashley the story of an exciting day at Santiago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be done,” the detective is saying, concluding
his narrative. “Your sympathies naturally stand in the
way, so I will relieve you of all active participation in
the affair. All you will have to do is to be a silent witness.
One thing you must do, though. You must see
Mrs. Ames and have her pledge that she will not let
her husband know that she has told you her story. I
must handle the affair gently, as Ames is as flashy as
gunpowder. You will see Helen, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; I will fix it immediately. When do you occupy
the center of the stage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-morrow. I will let you know in due season.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, old chap. I will be glad when it is all over.
So long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There are many happy hearts on the America this
night. The meeting between the sisters, Helen and
Louise, was a dramatic one, and after affectionate confidences
had been exchanged each sought the man she
loved best.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a shadow of sadness hovers about the four as they
sit on the quarter-deck and watch the big white moon
rise out of the sea. Now that all the excitement is over
Van Zandt has dropped back into his old reserve, and
the consciousness of his odd relations to Louise Hathaway
reverts to him with unpleasant keenness. Ames is
moody and abstracted and only the incessant flow of
spirits of Jack Ashley, who joins the group with Juanita,
keeps the little party alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>But bedtime comes early, for everyone is thoroughly
tired, and the party disperses with many a fervent “Good-night,
and pleasant dreams.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And as Van Zandt prepares to go below he feels a
touch on his arm and turns to see John Barker. “Mr.
Van Zandt, will you grant me a few minutes before you
retire?” requests the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly,” is the reply. “Come to my stateroom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ashley rises early the next morning and as he smokes
his after-breakfast cigar Barker joins him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall want you at ten o’clock, promptly,” says the
detective. “Meet me in the private cabin, or whatever
it is called on shipboard. I have secured exclusive use
of it for an hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” replies Jack, abstractedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Promptly at ten, Ashley repairs below, and as he enters
the cabin he finds Ames and Van Zandt there. They
look at him questioningly, but before he has opportunity
to say more than “Good-morning,” Barker enters, closes
the door and locks it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ames flushes angrily. “So,” he says, “it is at your
request that I am here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is,” replies the detective, calmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean, sir, by inviting me to this place
and locking the door upon me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I simply do not wish to be disturbed,” is Barker’s
unruffled response. “The cruiser America is now United
States territory. I have business with you, Mr. Ames.
Gentlemen, will you not be seated?”</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER LIX.<br /> <br /><span class='c009'>“WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF FATE.”</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You are a detective,” murmurs Derrick Ames, as he
drops back into his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am,” answers Barker. “For nearly a year I have
been on the track of the murderer of Roger Hathaway,
being ably seconded in my quest by my friend Jack
Ashley. The trail has been a tangled one, and has wound
under the flags of three countries, but for the past fortnight
the end has been clearly in view. By a remarkable
combination of circumstances affairs have been so precipitated
that to-day nearly all the living characters in the
Raymond drama are upon this vessel, the United States
cruiser America. My work is done. I have only my
story to tell. I shall begin, Mr. Ames, by asking you a
few questions,” resumes Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well?” queries the object of his remarks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At what hour did you enter the Raymond National
Bank on the evening of Memorial Day of last year?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot say exactly. I judge that it was in the vicinity
of 7:45.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you be good enough to state what took place
there between you and Roger Hathaway?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ames scans the detective’s face keenly for a moment,
then replies to Barker in deliberate tones:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I went to the bank to ask Mr. Hathaway’s consent
that his daughter Helen might become my wife. I was
confident that my errand was useless, as he had twice
before scorned my suit. Helen and I had been idling
all the afternoon on the hillside below the town. As
evening drew on I left her at the bars and went to the
bank, as she stated that she had understood her father
to say that he should spend the evening at work upon his
books. It being Memorial Day the streets were deserted,
and, barring one acquaintance, a chap named Sam Brockway,
I did not meet a person on my walk up the main
thoroughfare. As I crossed the bridge I saw Mr. Hathaway
standing on the steps of the bank, delivering a note
to a boy, and when he re-entered the building I followed
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘What do you want?’ he demanded, almost fiercely.
I told him, and he broke into a torrent of abuse. Naturally
hot-tempered, I answered his railings in kind, and
I know not what might have happened had not Mr.
Hathaway suddenly ended the dispute by seizing me by
the shoulder and pushing me through the bank door to
the street, threatening, as he did so, to have the law on
me if I continued my attentions to his daughter. Through
the glass panel in the door I watched him walk rapidly
away in the darkness of the interior; saw him as for an
instant his form passed into the lighted office in the rear
of the bank. Then the door to that room closed. I
never saw Roger Hathaway again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is sufficient,” says Barker, as Ames pauses.
“Your further progress up to to-day is known to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. And I may say that from the outset neither
Mr. Ashley nor myself believed you guilty of the murder
of Roger Hathaway. At the most, we considered that
you might have been a witness to the tragedy. But your
testimony is the last link in the chain. I am now prepared,
gentlemen, to relate what in all human probability
happened in Raymond on the evening of Memorial Day
last year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon me, Mr. Barker,” Van Zandt breaks in,
abruptly. “I regret to tell you that the trail which you
have so patiently followed has led you to what I should
judge, from your preliminary remarks, to be a false conclusion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What!” cries the detective, starting from his chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You think Cyrus Felton killed Roger Hathaway. So
did I once. We were wrong. If Cyrus Felton was responsible
for Hathaway’s death it was only indirectly,
and the Raymond tragedy was the cause of more misery
to him than any human being should be compelled to
bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker is too astounded to reply for an instant, and
Ames and Ashley stare questioningly at Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me relate briefly that much of my story which
bears directly upon the tragic events in Raymond,” says
Van Zandt, quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the afternoon of Memorial day of last year I was
released from the State prison at Windsor, Vermont,
after serving two of a three years’ sentence for forgery,
which, in reality, was committed by Ralph Felton. I
took the afternoon train for Raymond, arriving there at
7:45. I went directly to Cyrus Felton’s residence, and
reached it at 7:55. As I was about to ascend the porch
I heard footsteps behind me, and, thinking they might
be those of the man I sought, I stepped into the shadow
of the porch. The new arrival had apparently called to
see Felton on business. I heard the housemaid tell the
visitor that Felton was not at home; that he might be
at his office in the bank building. As the man walked
away I followed leisurely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I reached the entrance of the bank building a
man, presumably the caller at Felton’s, came down the
stairs and walked down the street. Then I went up the
stairs and proceeded down the corridor until I reached
a door with Felton’s name upon it. But the door was
locked and the office was dark. As I retraced my steps
and stood again at the entrance of the block a man
passed by hurriedly, ascended the steps to the bank,
opened the door and went in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I remained where I was for five minutes, and then
walked to the bank door and glanced through the glass
panel. The interior was dark, save for a ray of light
that issued through the partly opened door to the cashier’s
private office. Perhaps Felton is within, I thought,
and pushing open the front door, which was ajar, I
walked softly toward the shaft of light that slanted across
the bank floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What my errand to Felton was, gentlemen, it is not
necessary for me to now state. Enough to say that when
I threw open the door to the cashier’s office I looked
upon a sight that froze the blood in my veins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lying upon the polished floor, which was stained
with his life-blood, was the body of Roger Hathaway,
and standing over him was Cyrus Felton, a revolver
clenched in his right hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I made my appearance upon the threshold of
the office Felton turned his head and our eyes met for
an instant that must to each have seemed an age. Then
I closed the door, and a moment later stood at the entrance
of the bank, gasping for air. Can you not imagine
the horror in my soul? My one impulse was to flee from
the fearful scene. I had looked, as I thought, into the
face of Roger Hathaway’s slayer, and that was the man
to whom, incidentally at least, I owed the two past years
of misery. Falsely imprisoned for one crime, might I
not be accused of another and greater one? All this and
more flashed through my brain, and I hurried to the
railway station. There I learned that no train was due
for hours. I staggered away from the station and plunged
down the track into the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How I made my way over mountain and through forest
to southeastern Vermont and rode to New York on
the trucks of a freight car; how I read in a New York
paper of the crime that startled Vermont and of my supposed
connection with the affair; how in that same paper
I saw a personal advertising that if Phillip Van Zandt,
who left Montana over two years ago, would communicate
with Ezra Smith, lawyer of Butte, Montana, he
would learn of something to his advantage; how I, being
the much wanted Van Zandt, proceeded to Montana and
discovered that I was sole heir to the immense fortune
of my uncle, a silver king in that State, from whom I had
foolishly parted in anger two years before—all this and
more I will relate at another time, gentlemen, if you care
to listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not until late last night,” continues Van Zandt, “did
I have the opportunity of examining the papers given in
my possession by Cyrus Felton just before he died in the
consul’s residence at Santiago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As he speaks Van Zandt takes from his pocket a
packet of papers, selects one of them and tosses it across
the table to Barker. “Read that,” he says. “Read it
aloud.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective unfolds the document and reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Santiago de Cuba, April 15.—This is written by the hand
of fate. I shall not live to see to-morrow’s sun rise. I know
it. The presentiment of my end is so irresistible that no effort
of will can shake it off. And I am glad that it is so. I could
not endure another day such as this has been. I should go
mad.</p>

<p class='c014'>“To-day I saw the detective. I have felt that for months
he has been pursuing me. And I have looked again into the
eyes, the glittering, pitiless eyes, that stared at me nearly a
year ago across the corpse of Roger Hathaway—the eyes of
the man whom, to shield my son, I cruelly wronged. From
the hour, a month or more ago, that I met Phillip Van Zandt
I feared him. A nameless dread took possession of me. To-day
I recognized him and I read hatred, contempt and menace
in his eyes. He thinks I killed Roger Hathaway, and what
manner of vengeance he has in store I know not.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But Roger Hathaway killed himself. Together we wrecked
the Raymond National Bank. It was the old story of unfortunate
investments, and the blame was chiefly mine. But when
the crash was imminent Hathaway proved the hero and I
the coward. He killed himself and saved both his name and
mine. And yet with that bullet he put an end to all his troubles,
while I—I have suffered for months the tortures of the damned.</p>

<p class='c014'>“With this I inclose his letter, which he left on his desk
for me the evening of Memorial Day. It has been on my person
since that fatal night, and it has seared my very soul. I have
not dared to destroy it or to leave it where it might be found,
for it is at once the proof of my guilt and of my innocence.
If it becomes necessary to clear—</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ah, he is coming.</p>
<div class='c017'>Cyrus Felton.”</div>

<p class='c016'>Barker mechanically unfolds the inclosure, three sheets
of letter paper crumpled and worn. The stillness within
the cabin is deathlike as the detective reads:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before your eyes rest upon these lines the hand that pens
them will be cold in death. I have taken the only alternative.
For myself I care not, but that the finger of scorn should
be pointed at my defenseless children; that their young lives
should be blighted and they shunned and avoided as lepers
because their father betrayed his trust and cruelly wronged
his friends and neighbors, I cannot bear it. The banks, both
of them, are irretrievably involved. The funds deposited by the
county to pay the bonds have been used to meet pressing
obligations. The crash would come to-morrow. It cannot
be staved off another day. I have thought it all out. For
the sake of my children and the name they bear I am about
to take my own life. But they nor any other living person
save you must ever know that I did not die by the hand of the
assassin. I have arranged that it will appear as if the bank has
been robbed and the cashier murdered. As I write this room
bears evidence of a fearful struggle. The vault is open and
the securities in confusion. Thus will our crime be hidden
from the eyes of all save God. Your personal account overdrawn
I have fixed by the removal of pages from the ledger, so
that when the examination of the bank’s affairs is made there
may be no suspicion of irregularity on your part or mine.
You will be the first to find my lifeless body. The weapon by
which I die you must secure and secrete.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And now, farewell. That the sacrifice I am about to make
may not be in vain I adjure you guard well the secret of my
death. Care for my children. Watch over them, cherish
them. By our hope of heaven and forgiveness, by our life-long
friendship, by the bitter sacrifice to which duty points the
way, by all these things I charge you, Cyrus Felton, fail not
at the peril of your good name.</p>
<div class='c017'>Roger Hathaway.”</div>

<p class='c016'>As Barker concludes the reading of the remarkable
epistle each of the four men is busy with his thoughts.
No one offers any comment on the message from the
dead. Finally Ames breaks the silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Ralph Felton?” he queries, turning to Barker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had nothing whatever to do with the death of
Roger Hathaway,” returns the detective. “He refused
to answer the coroner’s question at the inquest as to
where he had spent his time between 7:45 o’clock and
8:30 on the evening of Memorial Day because he did not
wish his association with Isabel Winthrop, or Harding,
to become known when he had been a suitor for the hand
of Helen Hathaway. But that was not his principal
reason for leaving Raymond as suddenly as he did. As
bookkeeper of the savings bank he had embezzled a
portion of the funds—not a sensational peculation, only
sufficient to keep pace with his expenditures, which were
in excess of his income. Fearing that his offense would
be made public when the bank’s affairs were overhauled,
he fled. It was with difficulty that I extracted from him
yesterday afternoon a confession of his reason for leaving
Raymond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As to the locket supposed to have been removed from
Hathaway’s watch chain the night of the tragedy, and
which Mr. Ashley picked up a few nights ago, I supposed
until yesterday that it had been dropped by Ralph Felton.
But it seems that it was torn from Mr. Ames’ neck when
Felton hurled himself upon him on that memorable evening
at Jibana. Mr. Hathaway had detached it from his
chain the morning of Memorial Day, as the spring was
broken, and had given it to Helen to convey to the jeweler’s
to be repaired. It left Raymond with her, and when
she and her husband took up their Cuban life the miniature
of the younger sister was removed, for obvious
reasons, and Mr. Ames wore the locket about his neck,
attached to a long gold chain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Another silence, which this time Van Zandt breaks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that the facts in the case are in your possession,
Mr. Barker, I presume you will feel it your duty to report
them to the proper authorities.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective does not reply. He glances curiously at
Ashley, and the latter passes over a cigar, which the
detective bites in meditative fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you?” Van Zandt queries, turning to Ashley.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would make a capital story,” drawls Jack, who
has already told himself that the big bunch of “copy” in
the pigeonhole of his desk in the Hemisphere office will
never greet a compositor’s eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No doubt,” says Van Zandt, gravely. “But, like many
capital stories, it would be a source of endless pain to
two estimable young ladies. It would render nil the
sacrifice which Roger Hathaway made to preserve his
family name from disgrace, and would make a hollow
mockery of the simple epitaph which you tell me marks
the marble shaft above his grave—‘Faithful Unto
Death.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>The detective lights his cigar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there any likelihood, Mr. Barker, of the state of
Vermont paying the $1,000 reward which was offered?”
continues Van Zandt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None,” replies Barker. “The reward was for the
arrest and conviction of Roger Hathaway’s murderer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the additional $4,000 offered by the bank?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker smiles sardonically.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Zandt takes from his pocket a folded slip of paper
and passes it across the table to the detective.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a check for $5,000,” he says. “It is not a
bribe. It is only your just dues for the labors that you
have expended on the case. Personally, I am under deep
obligations to you. As to whether the Raymond mystery
shall remain a mystery, I leave it to your own sense of
duty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Barker folds the check slowly, and, as he slips it into
his vest pocket, he remarks, with a glance toward Ashley:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If my partner consents, the Hathaway case may as
well remain as now fixed in the coroner’s records in
Raymond, Vermont.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your partner came to that decision some time ago,”
is Ashley’s quiet response.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, gentlemen,” says Van Zandt, as he rises.
“And now, my friends, suppose we rejoin the ladies.
They will begin to think that we have deserted them.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
